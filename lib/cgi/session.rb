class CGI

  # == Overview
  #
  # This file provides the CGI::Session class, which provides session
  # support for CGI scripts.  A session is a sequence of HTTP requests
  # and responses linked together and associated with a single client.
  # Information associated with the session is stored
  # on the server between requests.  A session id is passed between client
  # and server with every request and response, transparently
  # to the user.  This adds state information to the otherwise stateless
  # HTTP request/response protocol.
  #
  # == Lifecycle
  #
  # A CGI::Session instance is created from a CGI object.  By default,
  # this CGI::Session instance will start a new session if none currently
  # exists, or continue the current session for this client if one does
  # exist.  The +new_session+ option can be used to either always or
  # never create a new session.  See #new() for more details.
  #
  # #delete() deletes a session from session storage.  It
  # does not however remove the session id from the client.  If the client
  # makes another request with the same id, the effect will be to start
  # a new session with the old session's id.
  #
  # == Setting and retrieving session data.
  #
  # The Session class associates data with a session as key-value pairs.
  # This data can be set and retrieved by indexing the Session instance
  # using '[]', much the same as hashes (although other hash methods
  # are not supported).
  #
  # When session processing has been completed for a request, the
  # session should be closed using the close() method.  This will
  # store the session's state to persistent storage.  If you want
  # to store the session's state to persistent storage without
  # finishing session processing for this request, call the update()
  # method.
  #
  # == Storing session state
  #
  # The caller can specify what form of storage to use for the session's
  # data with the +database_manager+ option to CGI::Session::new.  The
  # following storage classes are provided as part of the standard library:
  #
  # CGI::Session::FileStore:: stores data as plain text in a flat file.  Only
  #                           works with String data.  This is the default
  #                           storage type.
  # CGI::Session::MemoryStore:: stores data in an in-memory hash.  The data
  #                             only persists for as long as the current ruby
  #                             interpreter instance does.
  # CGI::Session::PStore:: stores data in Marshalled format.  Provided by
  #                        cgi/session/pstore.rb.  Supports data of any type,
  #                        and provides file-locking and transaction support.
  #
  # Custom storage types can also be created by defining a class with
  # the following methods:
  #
  #    new(session, options)
  #    restore  # returns hash of session data.
  #    update
  #    close
  #    delete
  #
  # Changing storage type mid-session does not work.  Note in particular
  # that by default the FileStore and PStore session data files have the
  # same name.  If your application switches from one to the other without
  # making sure that filenames will be different
  # and clients still have old sessions lying around in cookies, then
  # things will break nastily!
  #
  # == Maintaining the session id.
  #
  # Most session state is maintained on the server.  However, a session
  # id must be passed backwards and forwards between client and server
  # to maintain a reference to this session state.
  #
  # The simplest way to do this is via cookies.  The CGI::Session class
  # provides transparent support for session id communication via cookies
  # if the client has cookies enabled.
  #
  # If the client has cookies disabled, the session id must be included
  # as a parameter of all requests sent by the client to the server.  The
  # CGI::Session class in conjunction with the CGI class will transparently
  # add the session id as a hidden input field to all forms generated
  # using the CGI#form() HTML generation method.  No built-in support is
  # provided for other mechanisms, such as URL re-writing.  The caller is
  # responsible for extracting the session id from the session_id
  # attribute and manually encoding it in URLs and adding it as a hidden
  # input to HTML forms created by other mechanisms.  Also, session expiry
  # is not automatically handled.
  #
  # == Examples of use
  #
  # === Setting the user's name
  #
  #   require 'cgi'
  #   require 'cgi/session'
  #   require 'cgi/session/pstore'     # provides CGI::Session::PStore
  #
  #   cgi = CGI.new("html4")
  #
  #   session = CGI::Session.new(cgi,
  #       'database_manager' => CGI::Session::PStore,  # use PStore
  #       'session_key' => '_rb_sess_id',              # custom session key
  #       'session_expires' => Time.now + 30 * 60,     # 30 minute timeout
  #       'prefix' => 'pstore_sid_')                   # PStore option
  #   if cgi.has_key?('user_name') and cgi['user_name'] != ''
  #       # coerce to String: cgi[] returns the
  #       # string-like CGI::QueryExtension::Value
  #       session['user_name'] = cgi['user_name'].to_s
  #   elsif !session['user_name']
  #       session['user_name'] = "guest"
  #   end
  #   session.close
  #
  # === Creating a new session safely
  #
  #   require 'cgi'
  #   require 'cgi/session'
  #
  #   cgi = CGI.new("html4")
  #
  #   # We make sure to delete an old session if one exists,
  #   # not just to free resources, but to prevent the session
  #   # from being maliciously hijacked later on.
  #   begin
  #       session = CGI::Session.new(cgi, 'new_session' => false)
  #       session.delete
  #   rescue ArgumentError  # if no old session
  #   end
  #   session = CGI::Session.new(cgi, 'new_session' => true)
  #   session.close
  #

    # Create a new CGI::Session object for +request+.
    #
    # +request+ is an instance of the +CGI+ class (see cgi.rb).
    # +option+ is a hash of options for initialising this
    # CGI::Session instance.  The following options are
    # recognised:
    #
    # session_key:: the parameter name used for the session id.
    #               Defaults to '_session_id'.
    # session_id:: the session id to use.  If not provided, then
    #              it is retrieved from the +session_key+ parameter
    #              of the request, or automatically generated for
    #              a new session.
    # new_session:: if true, force creation of a new session.  If not set,
    #               a new session is only created if none currently
    #               exists.  If false, a new session is never created,
    #               and if none currently exists and the +session_id+
    #               option is not set, an ArgumentError is raised.
    # database_manager:: the name of the class providing storage facilities
    #                    for session state persistence.  Built-in support
    #                    is provided for +FileStore+ (the default),
    #                    +MemoryStore+, and +PStore+ (from
    #                    cgi/session/pstore.rb).  See the documentation for
    #                    these classes for more details.
    #
    # The following options are also recognised, but only apply if the
    # session id is stored in a cookie.
    #
    # session_expires:: the time the current session expires, as a
    #                   +Time+ object.  If not set, the session will terminate
    #                   when the user's browser is closed.
    # session_domain:: the hostname domain for which this session is valid.
    #                  If not set, defaults to the hostname of the server.
    # session_secure:: if +true+, this session will only work over HTTPS.
    # session_path:: the path for which this session applies.  Defaults
    #                to the directory of the CGI script.
    #
    # +option+ is also passed on to the session storage class initializer; see
    # the documentation for each session storage class for the options
    # they support.
    #
    # The retrieved or created session is automatically added to +request+
    # as a cookie, and also to its +output_hidden+ table, which is used
    # to add hidden input elements to forms.
    #
    # *WARNING* the +output_hidden+
    # fields are surrounded by a <fieldset> tag in HTML 4 generation, which
    # is _not_ invisible on many browsers; you may wish to disable the

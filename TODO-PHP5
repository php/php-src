Component:      Zend Engine 2

                Important stuff to finish: PPP members/PPP methods, 
                support of overloaded extensions, possibly differentiate 
                between class and namespace as discussed with Stig in 
                Germany.
Responsibility: Zeev, Andi, Stas
Time frame:     Couple of months for first part and extensions will be
                ongoing while PHP is being fixed.
                Things to leave for later versions: Native aggregation
                support, accessing static members via object and not class.

                We tried to take into account the implementation of each piece of
                information, and there are some that are problematic, especially those
                regarding constants and global variables (where do we store the extra
                information?)
                
                With "pre-scanned-phpdoc-string" we mean converting:
                
                /**
                 * Blah blah blah
                 * @param foo ...
                 */
                
                to:
                
                Blah blah blah
                @param foo
                
                The rest of the phpdoc handling should be left to an extension.

Component:      Thread Safety
                Identify the extensions that are not thread safe by design 
                or due to dependant libraries and identify them as such. 
                If possible try to resolve thread safety issue via code 
                improvements (if php code or patches will be accepted by 
                library maintainers).   For situations where thread safety 
                cannot easily be acheived a flag in the extension API is 
                set so PHP can identify non-thread safe extensions.  These 
                extensions will not be loaded in a ZTS compiled binary 
                (unless it is cli/cgi).

Component:      SAPI
                Environment variables defined in the CGI spec need to be 
                verified in each SAPI module that they conform to the CGI 
                spec correctly.  If they do not, the SAPI module needs to 
                fix the variable prior to script execution.  Having this 
                conformity will aid in having PHP scripts run correctly 
                under different sapi modules.

Timeframe:      ? (but shouldn't be much effort, most modules are probably ok)


Component:      Input Filtering
                - Implement a SAPI input filter hook that will get called
                  just before registering a variable in the 
                  treat_data/post_handler hooks.  (done)
                - Make sure this is also done in mbstring  (done)
                - Provide access functions, or perhaps a new 
                  $_RAW_GET/POST/Cookie set of superglobals to get at the
                  unfiltered data
                - Provide a .ini directive which allows people to set their
                  input filter to one of the built-in strip_tags,
                  htmlspecialchars or whatever other internal function might
                  be useful here.
                - (The main benefit of this is to make it easier for people
                   to solve the XSS problem once and for all without having
                   to go through every line of their code and adding input
                   validation/filtering everywhere)

Component:      OO Extensions
                Each OO extension has to be revised and rewritten to fit into
                the new OO model. We should decide which extensions are a must
                to have for the release and which can be ported by the maintainer
                later as a separate pecl release.
                A list of extensions to be extended that have to be investigated:
                  * browscap
                  * aggregate
                  * all *sql extensions (*_fetch_object)
                  * domxml (seems like christian is rewriting it anyways)
                  * ming

Component:      XML
                - Rewrite DOMXML and incorporate all (or most of) W3C-DOM2.
                - Use the new ZE2 features (Exceptions, setter/getter).
                - Add SAX(2), XML Schema.
                - XSLT, HTML, XPath, XPointer, DTD Validation will still be
                  supported, have to find a meaningful API for it.
                - Break BC, warn users now.
                - Look at the libxml2 patch by lukas schröder and see if we can prevent
                  memory leaks with it (anyway, getting rid of mem-leaks and intelligent
                  memory management is on top prio...)
                - In the longer term, domxml (or another name, as with todays features
                  domxml is a little bit misleading) shall be the main xml-class, which
                  covers most of what's needed for decent XML support in PHP ;)
                  But there is certainly place for others like Sablotron etc.

Component:      Test Suite
                Extending the test suite with atleast a test for every
                function in an extension that doesn't require external
                resources. Also developing an automated test thing which
                cvs ups's, compiles and tests the build on a daily base on
                as much platforms/extensions as possible.

                The test suite will also be extended to support threaded
                testing and testing for differing sapi modules (via http
                calls or other methods).

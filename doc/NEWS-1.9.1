== Changes since the 1.8.7 release
See doc/NEWS-1.8.7 for changes between 1.8.6 and 1.8.7.

=== Compatibility issues

* language core

    * New syntax and semantics
          o Block arguments are always local
          o New semantics for block arguments
          o defined? and local variables
          o Parser expects that your source code has only valid byte
            sequence in some character encoding.  Use magic comments
            to tell the parser which encoding you use.
          o New semantics for constant definition in instance_eval
            or in module_eval.

    * Deprecated syntax
          o colon (:) instead of "then" in if/unless or case expression.
          o retry in a loop or an iterator.

* builtin classes and objects

    * Kernel and Object
          o Kernel#methods and #singleton_methods used to return an 
            array of strings but now they return an array of symbols.
    * Class and Module
          o Module#attr works as Module#attr_reader by default.
	    Optional boolean argument is obsolete.
          o Module#instance_methods, #private_instance_methods and
            #public_instance_methods used to return an array of 
            strings but now they return an array of symbols.
          o Extra subclassing check when binding UnboundMethods
            
    * Exceptions
          o Exceptions are equal to each other if they belong to 
            the same class and have the same message and backtrace.
          o SystemStackError used to be a subclass of StandardError
            but not it is a direct subclass of Exception.
          o SecurityError: ditto
          o Removed Exception#to_str [Ruby2]

    * Enumerable and Enumerator
          o Enumerable::Enumerator, compatibility alias of Enumerator,
            is removed.
          o Enumerable#{map,collect} called without a block returns
            an enumerator.
          o Even more builtin and bundled libraries have been made to
            return an enumerator when called without a block.
    * Array
          o Array#nitems was removed (use count {|i| !i.nil?})
          o Array#choice was removed (use sample)
          o Array#[m,n] = nil places nil in the array.
    * Hash
          o Hash#to_s is equivalent to Hash#inspect
          o Semantics for Hash#each and Hash#each_pair
          o Hash#select returns a hash
          o Hash#key is the new name for #index which has been
            deprecated.
          o Hash preserves order.  It enumerates its elements in the
            order in which the keys are inserted.
          o Most of the changes in Hash apply to hash like interfaces
            such as ENV and *DBM.
    * IO operations
          o Many methods used to act byte-wise but now some of those act 
            character-wise. You can use alternate byte-wise methods.
          o IO#getc
          o Non-blocking IO
          o Kernel#open takes "t" for newline conversion
          o Kernel#open takes encoding specified
          o IO automatically converts byte sequence from a character
            encodings into another if specified.
          o StringIO#readpartial
          o IO.try_convert
          o IO.binread
          o IO.copy_stream
          o IO#binmode?
          o IO#close_on_exec= and IO#close_on_exec?
          o Limit input in IO#gets, IO#readline, IO#readlines,
            IO#each_line, IO#lines, IO.foreach, IO.readlines,
            StringIO#gets, StringIO#readline, StringIO#each,
            StringIO#readlines
          o IO#ungetc, StringIO#ungetc
          o IO#ungetbyte, StringIO#ungetbyte
          o IO#internal_encoding, IO#external_encoding,
            IO#set_encoding
          o IO.pipe takes encoding option
          o Directive %u behaves like %d for negative values in 
            printf-style formatting.
    * File and Dir operations
          o #to_path is called as necessary in File.path, File.chmod,
            File.lchmod, File.chown, File.lchown, File.utime,
            File.unlink, etc..
          o File.world_readable?
          o File.world_writable?
          o Dir.[], Dir.glob
          o Dir.exist?
          o Dir.exists?
    * File::Stat
          o File::Stat#world_readable?
          o File::Stat#world_writable?
    * String
          o No longer an Enumerable: use each_line/lines for line
            oriented operation
          o Encoding-awareness
              o Character-wise semantics in many methods instead of
                byte-wise.
                  o String#[]: Indexing a String with an integer returns a
                    single character String instead of an integer.
                  o String#[]=: No longer takes an integer as right
                    side value.  Note that "str[i] = ?c" because of
                    the following change.
                  o ?c is evaluated to a single character string
                    instead of an integer.
    * Regexp
          o Encoding-awareness
          o Regexp matches only with strings which is encoded in a
            compatible character encoding to the regexp's.
          o Regexp#kcode is removed. use Regexp#encoding.
    * Symbols: restriction on literal symbols
    * Numeric
          o Numeric#div always rounds as Integer#div has done.
          o Numeric#fdiv: ditto.
    * Integer
          o Integer(nil) raises TypeError
    * Fixnum
          o Fixnum#id2name removed
          o Fixnum#to_sym removed
    * Struct
          o Struct#inspect
    * Time
          o New format in Time#to_s
          o Timezone information preserved on Marshal.dump/load
    * $SAFE and bound methods
          o New trusted/untrusted model in addition to
            tainted/untainted model.

* bundled libraries

    * Pathname
          o No longer has #to_str nor #=~.

            first of the history.
    * Continuation

            not fully compatible with the original.

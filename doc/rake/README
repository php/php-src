= RAKE -- Ruby Make 

Supporting Rake version: 0.8.6

This package contains Rake, a simple ruby build program with
capabilities similar to make.

Rake has the following features:

* Rakefiles (rake's version of Makefiles) are completely defined in
  standard Ruby syntax.  No XML files to edit.  No quirky Makefile
  syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)

* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.

* Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.

* Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating
  file names and paths.

* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier. For example,
  tasks for building tarballs, gems and RDoc output are provided.

* Supports parallel execution of tasks.


== Installation

=== Gem Installation

Download and install  rake with the following.

   gem install rake

=== Normal Installation

You can download the source tarball of the latest version of Rake from

* http://rubyforge.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=50

Extract the tarball and run

  % ruby install.rb

from its distribution directory.

== Usage

=== Simple Example

First, you must write a "Rakefile" file which contains the build rules. Here's
a simple example:

  task :default => [:test]
  
  task :test do
    ruby "test/unittest.rb"
  end

This Rakefile has two tasks:

* A task named "test", which - upon invocation - will run a unit test file in
  Ruby.
* A task named "default". This task does nothing by itself, but it has exactly
  one dependency, namely the "test" task. Invoking the "default" task will
  cause Rake to invoke the "test" task as well.

Running the "rake" command without any options will cause it to run the
"default" task in the Rakefile:

  % ls
  Rakefile     test/
  % rake
  (in /home/some_user/Projects/rake)
  ruby test/unittest.rb
  ....unit test output here...

Type "rake --help" for all available options.

=== Running the Rake Test Suite

If you wish to run the unit and functional tests that come with Rake:

* Install the 'session' gem in order to run the functional tests.
* CD into the top project directory of rake.
* Type one of the following:

     rake                  # If you have a version of rake installed
     ruby -Ilib bin/rake   # If you do not have a version of rake installed.

Feel free to submit commits or feature requests.  If you send a patch,
remember to update the corresponding unit tests.  If fact, I prefer
new feature to be submitted in the form of new unit tests.

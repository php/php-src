  and removed inline source option).

== Version 0.8.5

* Better support for the system command on Windows.

== Version 0.8.4

* Preserve case when locating rakefiles (patch from James
  M. Lawrence/quix)

* Better support for windows paths in the test task (patch from Simon
  Chiang/bahuvrihi)

* Windows system dir search order is now: HOME, HOMEDRIVE + HOMEPATH,
  APPDATA, USERPROFILE (patch from Luis Lavena)

* MingGW is now recognized as a windows platform.  (patch from Luis

* Numerous fixes to the windows test suite (patch from Luis Lavena).

* Improved Rakefile case insensitivity testing (patch from Luis
  Lavena).

* Fixed stray ARGV option problem that was interfering with
  Test::Unit::Runner.

* Fixed default verbose mode (was accidently changed to false).  

* Removed reference to manage_gem to fix the warning produced by the
  gem package task.

== Version 0.8.3

* Enhanced the system directory detection in windows. We now check
  HOMEDRIVE/HOMEPATH and USERPROFILE if APPDATA isn't found. (Patch
  supplied by James Tucker). Rake no long aborts if it can't find the
  directory.

* Added fix to handle ruby installations in directories with spaces in
  their name.  

== Version 0.8.2

* Fixed bug in package task so that it will include the subdir
  directory in the package for testing. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

* Added ENV var to rakefile to prevent OS X from including extended
  attribute junk in a tar file. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

* Fixed filename dependency order bug in test_inspect_pending and
  test_to_s_pending. (Bug found by Adam Majer)

* Fixed check for file utils options to make them immune to the
  symbol/string differences. (Patch supplied by Edwin Pratomo)

* Fixed bug with rules involving multiple source (Patch supplied by
  Emanuel Indermühle)

* Switched from getoptlong to optparse (patches supplied by Edwin
  Pratomo)

* The -T option will now attempt to dynamically sense the size of the
  terminal.  RAKE_COLUMNS will override any dynamic sensing.

* FileList#clone and FileList#dup have better sematics w.r.t. taint
  and freeze.

* Added ability clear prerequisites, and/or actions from an existing
  task.

* Added the ability to reenable a task to be invoked a second time.

* Changed RDoc test task to have no default template. This makes it
  easier for the tempate to pick up the template from the environment.

* Changed from using Mutex to Monitor. Evidently Mutex causes thread
  join errors when Ruby is compiled with -disable-pthreads. (Patch
  supplied by Ittay Dror) 

* Fixed bug in makefile parser that had problems with extra spaces in
  file task names. (Patch supplied by Ittay Dror)

* Added a performance patch for reading large makefile dependency
  files. (Patch supplied by Ittay Dror)

* Default values for task arguments can easily be specified with the
  :with_defaults method. (Idea for default argument merging supplied
  by (Adam Q. Salter)

* The -T output will only self-truncate if the output is a tty.
  However, if RAKE_COLUMNS is explicitly set, it will be honored in
  any case. (Patch provided by Gavin Stark).

* Numerous fixes for running under windows. A big thanks to Bheeshmar
  Redheendran for spending a good part of the afternoon at the
  Lonestar Ruby Conference to help me work out these issues.

  exit(n) calls. (patch provided by Stephen Touset)
* Fixed error in functional tests that were not including session (and
  silently skipping the functionl tests.
* Removed --usage and make -h the same as -H.
* Make a prettier inspect for tasks.

== Version 0.7.3

* Added existing and existing! methods to FileList
* FileLists now claim to be Arrays (via is_a?) to get better support
  from the FileUtil module.
* Added init and top_level for custom rake applications.

== Version 0.7.2

* Error messages are now send to stderr rather than stdout (from
  Payton Quackenbush).
* Better error handling on invalid command line arguments (from Payton

  appliation instead of using its own data.
* Added square and curly bracket patterns to FileList#include (Tilman
  Sauerbeck). 
* Added plain filename support to rule dependents (suggested by Nobu
  Nakada). 
* Added pathmap support to rule dependents.
* Added a 'tasks' method to a namespace to get a list of tasks
  associated with the namespace.
* Fixed the method name leak from FileUtils (bug found by Glenn
  Vanderburg). 
* Added rake_extension to handle detection of extension collisions.
* Added test for noop, bad_option and verbose flags to sh command.

* Added optional filter parameter to the --tasks command line option.
* Added flatten to allow rule transform procs to return lists of
  prereqs (Joel VanderWerf provided patch).
* Added pathmap to String and FileList.
* The -r option will now load .rake files (but a straight require
  doesn't yet).  NOTE: This is experimental ... it may be
  discontinued.
* The -f option without a value will disable the search for a
  Rakefile.  The assumption is that the -r files are adequate.

* Made the RDoc task default to internal (in-process) RDoc formatting.
  The old behavior is still available by setting the +external+ flag
  to true.
* Rakefiles are now loaded with the expanded path to prevent
  accidental polution from the Ruby load path.
* The +namespace+ command now returns a NameSpace object that can be
  used to lookup tasks defined in that namespace.  This allows for
  better anonymous namespace behavior.
* Task objects my now be used in prerequisite lists directly.

* Fixed file creation bug in the unit tests (caused infinite loop on
  windows).
* Fixed bug where session based functional tests were run under
  windows.
* Fixed bug in directory tasks so that updating a directory will not
  retrigger file tasks depending on the directory (see
  FileCreationTask and EarlyTime).
* Added egrep to FileList
* ruby command now runs same ruby version as rake.
* Added investigation to task object. (suggested by Martin Fowler)

  module namespace.  Old style namespace behavior can be invoked via
  the --classic-namespace option. (requested by Kelly Felkins).
* GemTask is now sensitive to the gem platform (Masao Mutoh).
* A non-existing file prerequisite will no longer cause an exception
  (Philipp Neubeck).

  as existing files.
* Fixed verbose flag bug in the testing task.  Shortened some failure
  messages.
* Make FileUtils methods private at the top level module to avoid
  accidental method leaking into other objects.
* Added test loader option to test task.  "testrb" is no longer the
  default test loader.  It is now eating syntax errors that should
  halt the unit tests.
* Revamped FileList so that it works more like and array (addressed
  flatten bug).  Added many tests around file list.
* Added +ext+ method to both String and FileList.

  variable $rakefile (which contains the actual name of the rakefile).

== Version 0.4.10

* Added block support to the "sh" command, allowing users to take
  special actions on the result of the system call.  E.g.

    sh "shell_command" do |ok, res|
      puts "Program returned #{res.exitstatus}" if ! ok
    end

== Version 0.4.9

* Switched to Jamis Buck's RDoc template.
* Removed autorequire from Rake's gem spec.  This prevents the Rake
  libraries from loading while using rails.

* Added support for .rb versions of Rakefile.
* Removed \\\n's from test task.
* Fixed Ruby 1.9 compatibility issue with FileList.

== Version 0.4.7

* Fixed problem in FileList that caused Ruby 1.9 to go into infinite
  recursion.  Since to_a was removed from Object, it does not need to
  added back into the list of methods to rewrite in FileList.  (Thanks
  to Kent Sibilev for pointing this out).

  using the built-in test task macros because the rake runtime is no
  longer needed.
* Added 'TEST=filename' and 'TESTOPTS=options' to the Test Task
  macros.
* Allow a +test_files+ attribute in test tasks.  This allows more
  flexibility in specifying test files.

  until the first call that needs the file names.
* VAR=VALUE options are now accepted on the command line and are
  treated like environment variables.  The values may be tested in a
  Rakefile by referencing ENV['VAR'].
* File.mtime is now used (instead of File.new().mtime).

== Version 0.3.2.x

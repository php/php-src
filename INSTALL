Installation Instructions for PHP3
----------------------------------

For the impatient here is a quick set of steps that will build PHP3
as an Apache module for Apache 1.3.0 with MySQL support.  A more verbose 
explanation follows.


QUICK INSTALL

gunzip apache_1.3.x.tar.gz
tar xvf apache_1.3.x.tar
gunzip php-3.0.x.tar.gz
tar xvf php-3.0.x.tar
cd apache_1.3.x
./configure --prefix=/www
cd ../php-3.0.x
./configure --with-mysql --with-apache=../apache_1.3.x --enable-track-vars
make
make install
cd ../apache_1.3.x
./configure --prefix=/www --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a
 (The above line is correct!  Yes, we know libphp3.a does not exist at this
  stage.  It isn't supposed to.  It will be created.)
make
 (you should now have an httpd binary which you can copy to your Apache bin dir)
cd ../php-3.0.x
cp php3.ini-dist /usr/local/lib/php3.ini
You can edit /usr/local/lib/php3.ini file to set PHP options.
Edit your httpd.conf or srm.conf file and add:
  AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3


VERBOSE INSTALL

Installing PHP3 can be done in four simple steps:

1. Unpack your distribution file.  

   You will have downloaded a file named something like php3xn.tar.gz.
   Unzip this file with a command like: gunzip php3xn.tar.gz

   Next you have to untar it with: tar -xvf php3xn.tar

   This will create a php-3.0.x directory.  cd into this new directory.

2. Configure PHP3.

   You now have to choose the options you would like.  There are quite
   a few of them.  To see a list, type: ./configure --help

   You can also use the supplied 'setup' script, which will ask you
   a series of questions and automatically run the configure script
   for you.

   The only options that you are likely to want to use are the ones in
   the last section entitled, "--enable and --with options recognized:"

   A popular choice is to build the Apache module version.  You need
   to know where the source code directory for your Apache server is
   located.  Then use an option like: --with-apache=/usr/local/src/apache
   if that is your Apache source code directory.  If you only specify
   --with-apache, then it will default to look for your Apache source 
   in /usr/local/etc/httpd.

   NOTE: The directory you specify should be the top-level of the
   unpacked Apache (or Stronghold) distribution. The configure program
   will automatically look for httpd.h in different directories under that
   location depending on which version of Apache, including Stronghold,
   you are running.

   For MySQL support, since newer versions of MySQL installs its various
   components under /usr/local, this is the default.  If you have
   changed the location you can specify it with: --with-mysql=/opt/local
   for example.  Otherwise just use: --with-mysql

   *NOTE*  If you are using Apache 1.3b6 or later, you should run the 
   Apache Configure script at least once before compiling PHP.  It 
   doesn't matter how you have Apache configured at this point.

3. Compile and install the files.  Simply type: make install

   For the Apache module version this will copy the appropriate files
   to the src/modules/php3 directory in your Apache distribution if
   you are using Apache 1.3.x.  If you are still running Apache 1.2.x
   these files will be copied directly to the main src directory.

   For Apache 1.3b6 and later, you can use the new APACI configuration
   mechanism.  To automatically build Apache with PHP support, use:

       cd apache_1.3.x
       ./configure --prefix=/<path>/apache \
                   --activate-module=src/modules/php3/libphp3.a
       make
       make install

   If you do not wish to use this new configuration tool, the old
   install procedure (src/Configure) will work fine.

   If you are using the old Apache ./Configure script, you will have to 
   edit the Apache src/Configuration file manually.  If you do not have 
   this file, copy Configuration.tmpl to Configuration.

   For Apache 1.3.x add:

      AddModule modules/php3/libphp3.a

   For Apache 1.3.x don't do anything else.  Just add this line and then
   run "./Configure" followed by "make".

   For Apache 1.2.x add:

      Module php3_module mod_php3.o

   For Apache 1.2.x you will also have to look in the libphp3.module file,
   which was copied to the src directory. The EXTRA_LIBS line in the Apache
   Configuration file needs to be set to use the same libs as specified on
   the LIBS line in libphp3.module. You also need to make sure to add
   "-L." to the beginning of the EXTRA_LIBS line.

   So, as an example, your EXTRA_LIBS line might look like:

	EXTRA_LIBS=-L. -lphp3 -lgdbm -ldb -L/usr/local/mysql/lib -lmysqlclient

   NOTE: You should not enclose the EXTRA_LIBS line in double-quotes, as it
   is in the libphp3.module file.

   Also, look at the RULE_WANTHSREGEX setting in the libphp3.module file 
   and set the WANTHSREGEX directive accordingly in your Configuration file.
   This last step applies to versions of Apache prior to 1.3b3.

   This is a bit of a hassle, but should serve as incentive to move to
   Apache 1.3.x where this step has been eliminated.

   Once you are satisfied with your Configuration settings, type: ./Configure
   If you get errors, chances are that you forgot a library or made a typo
   somewhere.  Re-edit Configuration and try again.  If it goes well,
   type: make

4. Setting up the server.
   
   You should now have a new httpd binary.  Shut down your existing server,
   if you have one, and copy this new binary overtop of it.  Perhaps make
   a backup of your previous one first.  Then edit your conf/srm.conf file
   and add the line:

      AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3

   There is also an interesting feature which can be quite instructive and
   helpful while debugging.  That is the option of having colour syntax
   highlighting.  To enable this, add the following line:

      AddType application/x-httpd-php3-source .phps

   Any file ending in .phps will now be displayed with full colour syntax
   highlighting instead of being executed.

   When you are finished making changes to your srm.conf file, you can
   start up your server.

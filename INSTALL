Chapter 1. General Installation Considerations

   Before starting the installation, first you need to know what do you
   want to use PHP for. There are three main fields you can use PHP, as
   described in the What can PHP do? section:

     * Websites and web applications (server-side scripting)
     * Command line scripting
     * Desktop (GUI) applications

   For the first and most common form, you need three things: PHP itself,
   a web server and a web browser. You probably already have a web
   browser, and depending on your operating system setup, you may also
   have a web server (e.g. Apache on Linux and MacOS X; IIS on Windows).
   You may also rent webspace at a company. This way, you don't need to
   set up anything on your own, only write your PHP scripts, upload it to
   the server you rent, and see the results in your browser.

   In case of setting up the server and PHP on your own, you have two
   choices for the method of connecting PHP to the server. For many
   servers PHP has a direct module interface (also called SAPI). These
   servers include Apache, Microsoft Internet Information Server, Netscape
   and iPlanet servers. Many other servers have support for ISAPI, the
   Microsoft module interface (OmniHTTPd for example). If PHP has no
   module support for your web server, you can always use it as a CGI or
   FastCGI processor. This means you set up your server to use the CGI
   executable of PHP to process all PHP file requests on the server.

   If you are also interested to use PHP for command line scripting (e.g.
   write scripts autogenerating some images for you offline, or processing
   text files depending on some arguments you pass to them), you always
   need the command line executable. For more information, read the
   section about writing command line PHP applications. In this case, you
   need no server and no browser.

   With PHP you can also write desktop GUI applications using the PHP-GTK
   extension. This is a completely different approach than writing web
   pages, as you do not output any HTML, but manage Windows and objects
   within them. For more information about PHP-GTK, please visit the site
   dedicated to this extension. PHP-GTK is not included in the official
   PHP distribution.

   From now on, this section deals with setting up PHP for web servers on
   Unix and Windows with server module interfaces and CGI executables. You
   will also find information on the command line executable in the
   following sections.

   PHP source code and binary distributions for Windows can be found at
   http://www.php.net/downloads.php. We recommend you to choose a mirror
   nearest to you for downloading the distributions.
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 2. Installation on Unix systems

   This section will guide you through the general configuration and
   installation of PHP on Unix systems. Be sure to investigate any
   sections specific to your platform or web server before you begin the
   process.

   As our manual outlines in the General Installation Considerations
   section, we are mainly dealing with web centric setups of PHP in this
   section, although we will cover setting up PHP for command line usage
   as well.

   There are several ways to install PHP for the Unix platform, either
   with a compile and configure process, or through various pre-packaged
   methods. This documentation is mainly focused around the process of
   compiling and configuring PHP. Many Unix like systems have some sort of
   package installation system. This can assist in setting up a standard
   configuration, but if you need to have a different set of features
   (such as a secure server, or a different database driver), you may need
   to build PHP and/or your web server. If you are unfamiliar with
   building and compiling your own software, it is worth checking to see
   whether somebody has already built a packaged version of PHP with the
   features you need.

   Prerequisite knowledge and software for compiling:

     * Basic Unix skills (being able to operate "make" and a C compiler)
     * An ANSI C compiler
     * flex: Version 2.5.4
     * bison: Version 1.28 (preferred), 1.35, or 1.75
     * A web server
     * Any module specific components (such as gd, pdf libs, etc.)

   The initial PHP setup and configuration process is controlled by the
   use of the command line options of the configure script. You could get
   a list of all available options along with short explanations running
   ./configure --help. Our manual documents the different options
   separately. You will find the core options in the appendix, while the
   different extension specific options are descibed on the reference
   pages.

   When PHP is configured, you are ready to build the module and/or
   executables. The command make should take care of this. If it fails and
   you can't figure out why, see the Problems section.
     __________________________________________________________________

Apache 1.3.x on Unix systems

   This section contains notes and hints specific to Apache installs of
   PHP on Unix platforms. We also have instructions and notes for Apache 2
   on a separate page.

   You can select arguments to add to the configure on line 10 below from
   the list of core configure options and from extension specific options
   described at the respective places in the manual. The version numbers
   have been omitted here, to ensure the instructions are not incorrect.
   You will need to replace the 'xxx' here with the correct values from
   your files.

   Example 2-1. Installation Instructions (Apache Shared Module Version)
   for PHP
1.  gunzip apache_xxx.tar.gz
2.  tar -xvf apache_xxx.tar
3.  gunzip php-xxx.tar.gz
4.  tar -xvf php-xxx.tar
5.  cd apache_xxx
6.  ./configure --prefix=/www --enable-module=so
7.  make
8.  make install
9.  cd ../php-xxx

10. Now, configure your PHP.  This is where you customize your PHP
    with various options, like which extensions will be enabled.  Do a
    ./configure --help for a list of available options.  In our example
    we'll do a simple configure with Apache 1 and MySQL support.  Your
    path to apxs may differ from our example.

      ./configure --with-mysql --with-apxs=/www/bin/apxs

11. make
12. make install

    If you decide to change your configure options after installation,
    you only need to repeat the last three steps. You only need to
    restart apache for the new module to take effect. A recompile of
    Apache is not needed.

    Note that unless told otherwise, 'make install' will also install PEAR,
    various PHP tools such as phpize, install the PHP CLI, and more.

13. Setup your php.ini file:

    PHP will use the built-in default values if no php.ini file was
    placed in the configuration directory. The default location is
    /usr/local/lib, if you prefer your php.ini in another location, use 
    --with-config-file-path=/some/path in step 10.

    The PHP distribution provides two sample php.ini files, you can use them
    by
      cp php.ini-development /usr/local/lib/php.ini
    or
      cp php.ini-production  /usr/local/lib/php.ini

    If you choose one of these php.ini files be certain to read the list
    of changes within, as they affect how PHP behaves.

14. Edit your httpd.conf to load the PHP module.  The path on the right hand
    side of the LoadModule statement must point to the path of the PHP
    module on your system.  The make install from above may have already
    added this for you, but be sure to check.

    For PHP 4:

      LoadModule php4_module libexec/libphp4.so

    For PHP 5:

      LoadModule php5_module libexec/libphp5.so

15. And in the AddModule section of httpd.conf, somewhere under the
    ClearModuleList, add this:

    For PHP 4:

      AddModule mod_php4.c

    For PHP 5:

      AddModule mod_php5.c

16. Tell Apache to parse certain extensions as PHP.  For example,
    let's have Apache parse the .php extension as PHP.  You could
    have any extension(s) parse as PHP by simply adding more, with
    each separated by a space.  We'll add .phtml to demonstrate.

      AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml

    It's also common to setup the .phps extension to show highlighted PHP
    source, this can be done with:

      AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

17. Use your normal procedure for starting the Apache server. (You must
    stop and restart the server, not just cause the server to reload by
    using a HUP or USR1 signal.)

   Alternatively, to install PHP as a static object:

   Example 2-2. Installation Instructions (Static Module Installation for
   Apache) for PHP
1.  gunzip -c apache_1.3.x.tar.gz | tar xf -
2.  cd apache_1.3.x
3.  ./configure
4.  cd ..

5.  gunzip -c php-5.x.y.tar.gz | tar xf -
6.  cd php-5.x.y
7.  ./configure --with-mysql --with-apache=../apache_1.3.x
8.  make
9.  make install

10. cd ../apache_1.3.x

11. ./configure --prefix=/www --activate-module=src/modules/php5/libphp5.a
    (The above line is correct! Yes, we know libphp5.a does not exist at this
    stage. It isn't supposed to. It will be created.)

12. make
    (you should now have an httpd binary which you can copy to your Apache bin d
ir if
    it is your first install then you need to "make install" as well)

13. cd ../php-5.x.y
14. cp php.ini-dist /usr/local/lib/php.ini

15. You can edit /usr/local/lib/php.ini file to set PHP options.
    Edit your httpd.conf or srm.conf file and add:
    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

     Note: Replace php-5 by php-4 and php5 by php4 in PHP 4.

   Depending on your Apache install and Unix variant, there are many
   possible ways to stop and restart the server. Below are some typical
   lines used in restarting the server, for different apache/unix
   installations. You should replace /path/to/ with the path to these
   applications on your systems.

   Example 2-3. Example commands for restarting Apache
1. Several Linux and SysV variants:
/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd restart

2. Using apachectl scripts:
/path/to/apachectl stop
/path/to/apachectl start

3. httpdctl and httpsdctl (Using OpenSSL), similar to apachectl:
/path/to/httpsdctl stop
/path/to/httpsdctl start

4. Using mod_ssl, or another SSL server, you may want to manually
stop and start:
/path/to/apachectl stop
/path/to/apachectl startssl

   The locations of the apachectl and http(s)dctl binaries often vary. If
   your system has locate or whereis or which commands, these can assist
   you in finding your server control programs.

   Different examples of compiling PHP for apache are as follows:

   ./configure --with-apxs --with-pgsql

   This will create a libphp5.so (or libphp4.so in PHP 4) shared library
   that is loaded into Apache using a LoadModule line in Apache's
   httpd.conf file. The PostgreSQL support is embedded into this library.

   ./configure --with-apxs --with-pgsql=shared

   This will create a libphp4.so shared library for Apache, but it will
   also create a pgsql.so shared library that is loaded into PHP either by
   using the extension directive in php.ini file or by loading it
   explicitly in a script using the dl() function.

   ./configure --with-apache=/path/to/apache_source --with-pgsql

   This will create a libmodphp5.a library, a mod_php5.c and some
   accompanying files and copy this into the src/modules/php5 directory in
   the Apache source tree. Then you compile Apache using
   --activate-module=src/modules/php5/libphp5.a and the Apache build
   system will create libphp5.a and link it statically into the httpd
   binary (replace php5 by php4 in PHP 4). The PostgreSQL support is
   included directly into this httpd binary, so the final result here is a
   single httpd binary that includes all of Apache and all of PHP.

   ./configure --with-apache=/path/to/apache_source --with-pgsql=shared

   Same as before, except instead of including PostgreSQL support directly
   into the final httpd you will get a pgsql.so shared library that you
   can load into PHP from either the php.ini file or directly using dl().

   When choosing to build PHP in different ways, you should consider the
   advantages and drawbacks of each method. Building as a shared object
   will mean that you can compile apache separately, and don't have to
   recompile everything as you add to, or change, PHP. Building PHP into
   apache (static method) means that PHP will load and run faster. For
   more information, see the Apache web page on DSO support.

     Note: Apache's default httpd.conf currently ships with a section
     that looks like this:

User nobody
Group "#-1"

     Unless you change that to "Group nogroup" or something like that
     ("Group daemon" is also very common) PHP will not be able to open
     files.

     Note: Make sure you specify the installed version of apxs when using
     --with-apxs=/path/to/apxs. You must NOT use the apxs version that is
     in the apache sources but the one that is actually installed on your
     system.

Apache 2.0 on Unix systems

   This section contains notes and hints specific to Apache 2.0 installs
   of PHP on Unix systems.

   Warning

   We do not recommend using a threaded MPM in production with Apache2.
   Use the prefork MPM instead, or use Apache1. For information on why,
   read the related FAQ entry on using Apache2 with a threaded MPM

   You are highly encouraged to take a look at the Apache Documentation to
   get a basic understanding of the Apache 2.0 Server.

     PHP and Apache 2.0.x compatibility notes: The following versions of
     PHP are known to work with the most recent version of Apache 2.0.x:

     * PHP 4.3.0 or later available at http://www.php.net/downloads.php.
     * the latest stable development version. Get the source code
       http://snaps.php.net/php5-latest.tar.gz or download binaries for
       Windows http://snaps.php.net/win32/php5-win32-latest.zip.
     * a prerelease version downloadable from http://qa.php.net/.
     * you have always the option to obtain PHP through SVN.

     These versions of PHP are compatible to Apache 2.0.40 and later.

     Apache 2.0 SAPI-support started with PHP 4.2.0. PHP 4.2.3 works with
     Apache 2.0.39, don't use any other version of Apache with PHP 4.2.3.
     However, the recommended setup is to use PHP 4.3.0 or later with the
     most recent version of Apache2.

     All mentioned versions of PHP will work still with Apache 1.3.x.

   Download the most recent version of Apache 2.0 and a fitting PHP
   version from the above mentioned places. This quick guide covers only
   the basics to get started with Apache 2.0 and PHP. For more information
   read the Apache Documentation. The version numbers have been omitted
   here, to ensure the instructions are not incorrect. You will need to
   replace the 'NN' here with the correct values from your files.

   Example 2-4. Installation Instructions (Apache 2 Shared Module Version)
1.  gzip -d httpd-2_0_NN.tar.gz
2.  tar xvf httpd-2_0_NN.tar
3.  gunzip php-NN.tar.gz
4.  tar -xvf php-NN.tar
5.  cd httpd-2_0_NN
6.  ./configure --enable-so
7.  make
8.  make install

    Now you have Apache 2.0.NN available under /usr/local/apache2,
    configured with loadable module support and the standard MPM prefork.
    To test the installation use your normal procedure for starting
    the Apache server, e.g.:
    /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start
    and stop the server to go on with the configuration for PHP:
    /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl stop.

9.  cd ../php-NN

10. Now, configure your PHP.  This is where you customize your PHP
    with various options, like which extensions will be enabled.  Do a
    ./configure --help for a list of available options.  In our example
    we'll do a simple configure with Apache 2 and MySQL support.  Your
    path to apxs may differ, in fact, the binary may even be named apxs2 on
    your system.

      ./configure --with-apxs2=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs --with-mysql

11. make
12. make install

    If you decide to change your configure options after installation,
    you only need to repeat the last three steps. You only need to
    restart apache for the new module to take effect. A recompile of
    Apache is not needed.

    Note that unless told otherwise, 'make install' will also install PEAR,
    various PHP tools such as phpize, install the PHP CLI, and more.

13. Setup your php.ini

    cp php.ini-dist /usr/local/lib/php.ini

    You may edit your .ini file to set PHP options.  If you prefer having
    php.ini in another location, use --with-config-file-path=/some/path in
    step 10.

    If you instead choose php.ini-recommended, be certain to read the list
    of changes within, as they affect how PHP behaves.

14. Edit your httpd.conf to load the PHP module.  The path on the right hand
    side of the LoadModule statement must point to the path of the PHP
    module on your system.  The make install from above may have already
    added this for you, but be sure to check.

    For PHP 4:

      LoadModule php4_module modules/libphp4.so

    For PHP 5:

      LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so

15. Tell Apache to parse certain extensions as PHP.  For example,
    let's have Apache parse the .php extension as PHP.  You could
    have any extension(s) parse as PHP by simply adding more, with
    each separated by a space.  We'll add .phtml to demonstrate.

      AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml

    It's also common to setup the .phps extension to show highlighted PHP
    source, this can be done with:

      AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

16. Use your normal procedure for starting the Apache server, e.g.:

      /usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start

   Following the steps above you will have a running Apache 2.0 with
   support for PHP as SAPI module. Of course there are many more
   configuration options available for both, Apache and PHP. For more
   information use ./configure --help in the corresponding source tree. In
   case you wish to build a multithreaded version of Apache 2.0 you must
   overwrite the standard MPM-Module prefork either with worker or
   perchild. To do so append to your configure line in step 6 above either
   the option --with-mpm=worker or --with-mpm=perchild. Take care about
   the consequences and understand what you are doing. For more
   information read the Apache documentation about the MPM-Modules.

     Note: If you want to use content negotiation, read the Apache
     MultiViews FAQ.

     Note: To build a multithreaded version of Apache your system must
     support threads. This also implies to build PHP with experimental
     Zend Thread Safety (ZTS). Therefore not all extensions might be
     available. The recommended setup is to build Apache with the
     standard prefork MPM-Module.
     __________________________________________________________________

Caudium

   PHP 4 can be built as a Pike module for the Caudium webserver. Note
   that this is not supported with PHP 3. Follow the simple instructions
   below to install PHP 4 for Caudium.

   Example 2-5. Caudium Installation Instructions
1.  Make sure you have Caudium installed prior to attempting to
    install PHP 4. For PHP 4 to work correctly, you will need Pike
    7.0.268 or newer. For the sake of this example we assume that
    Caudium is installed in /opt/caudium/server/.
2.  Change directory to php-x.y.z (where x.y.z is the version number).
3.  ./configure --with-caudium=/opt/caudium/server
4.  make
5.  make install
6.  Restart Caudium if it's currently running.
7.  Log into the graphical configuration interface and go to the
    virtual server where you want to add PHP 4 support.
8.  Click Add Module and locate and then add the PHP 4 Script Support module.
9.  If the documentation says that the 'PHP 4 interpreter isn't
    available', make sure that you restarted the server. If you did
    check /opt/caudium/logs/debug/default.1 for any errors related to
    <filename>PHP4.so</filename>. Also make sure that
    <filename>caudium/server/lib/[pike-version]/PHP4.so</filename>
    is present.
10. Configure the PHP Script Support module if needed.

   You can of course compile your Caudium module with support for the
   various extensions available in PHP 4. See the reference pages for
   extension specific configure options.

     Note: When compiling PHP 4 with MySQL support you must make sure
     that the normal MySQL client code is used. Otherwise there might be
     conflicts if your Pike already has MySQL support. You do this by
     specifying a MySQL install directory the --with-mysql option.
     __________________________________________________________________

fhttpd related notes

   To build PHP as an fhttpd module, answer "yes" to "Build as an fhttpd
   module?" (the --with-fhttpd=DIR option to configure) and specify the
   fhttpd source base directory. The default directory is
   /usr/local/src/fhttpd. If you are running fhttpd, building PHP as a
   module will give better performance, more control and remote execution
   capability.

     Note: Support for fhttpd is no longer available as of PHP 4.3.0.
     __________________________________________________________________

Sun, iPlanet and Netscape servers on Sun Solaris

   This section contains notes and hints specific to Sun Java System Web
   Server, Sun ONE Web Server, iPlanet and Netscape server installs of PHP
   on Sun Solaris.

   From PHP 4.3.3 on you can use PHP scripts with the NSAPI module to
   generate custom directory listings and error pages. Additional
   functions for Apache compatibility are also available. For support in
   current web servers read the note about subrequests.

   You can find more information about setting up PHP for the Netscape
   Enterprise Server (NES) here:
   http://benoit.noss.free.fr/php/install-php4.html

   To build PHP with Sun JSWS/Sun ONE WS/iPlanet/Netscape web servers,
   enter the proper install directory for the --with-nsapi=[DIR] option.
   The default directory is usually /opt/netscape/suitespot/. Please also
   read /php-xxx-version/sapi/nsapi/nsapi-readme.txt.

    1. Install the following packages from http://www.sunfreeware.com/ or
       another download site:

       autoconf-2.13
       automake-1.4
       bison-1_25-sol26-sparc-local
       flex-2_5_4a-sol26-sparc-local
       gcc-2_95_2-sol26-sparc-local
       gzip-1.2.4-sol26-sparc-local
       m4-1_4-sol26-sparc-local
       make-3_76_1-sol26-sparc-local
       mysql-3.23.24-beta (if you want mysql support)
       perl-5_005_03-sol26-sparc-local
       tar-1.13 (GNU tar)
    2. Make sure your path includes the proper directories
       PATH=.:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin and make it
       available to your system export PATH.
    3. gunzip php-x.x.x.tar.gz (if you have a .gz dist, otherwise go to
       4).
    4. tar xvf php-x.x.x.tar
    5. Change to your extracted PHP directory: cd ../php-x.x.x
    6. For the following step, make sure /opt/netscape/suitespot/ is where
       your netscape server is installed. Otherwise, change to the correct
       path and run:

./configure --with-mysql=/usr/local/mysql \
--with-nsapi=/opt/netscape/suitespot/ \
--enable-libgcc

    7. Run make followed by make install.

   After performing the base install and reading the appropriate readme
   file, you may need to perform some additional configuration steps.

   Configuration Instructions for Sun/iPlanet/Netscape. Firstly you may
   need to add some paths to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment for the
   server to find all the shared libs. This can best done in the start
   script for your web server. The start script is often located in:
   /path/to/server/https-servername/start. You may also need to edit the
   configuration files that are located in:
   /path/to/server/https-servername/config/.

    1. Add the following line to mime.types (you can do that by the
       administration server):

type=magnus-internal/x-httpd-php exts=php

    2. Edit magnus.conf (for servers >= 6) or obj.conf (for servers < 6)
       and add the following, shlib will vary depending on your system, it
       will be something like /opt/netscape/suitespot/bin/libphp4.so. You
       should place the following lines after mime types init.

Init fn="load-modules" funcs="php4_init,php4_execute,php4_auth_trans" shlib="/op
t/netscape/suitespot/bin/libphp4.so"
Init fn="php4_init" LateInit="yes" errorString="Failed to initialize PHP!" [php_
ini="/path/to/php.ini"]

       (PHP >= 4.3.3) The php_ini parameter is optional but with it you
       can place your php.ini in your web server config directory.
    3. Configure the default object in obj.conf (for virtual server
       classes [version 6.0+] in their vserver.obj.conf):

<Object name="default">
.
.
.
.#NOTE this next line should happen after all 'ObjectType' and before all 'AddLo
g' lines
Service fn="php4_execute" type="magnus-internal/x-httpd-php" [inikey=value inike
y=value ...]
.
.
</Object>

       (PHP >= 4.3.3) As additional parameters you can add some special
       php.ini-values, for example you can set a
       docroot="/path/to/docroot" specific to the context php4_execute is
       called. For boolean ini-keys please use 0/1 as value, not
       "On","Off",... (this will not work correctly), e.g.
       zlib.output_compression=1 instead of zlib.output_compression="On"
    4. This is only needed if you want to configure a directory that only
       consists of PHP scripts (same like a cgi-bin directory):

<Object name="x-httpd-php">
ObjectType fn="force-type" type="magnus-internal/x-httpd-php"
Service fn=php4_execute [inikey=value inikey=value ...]
</Object>

       After that you can configure a directory in the Administration
       server and assign it the style x-httpd-php. All files in it will
       get executed as PHP. This is nice to hide PHP usage by renaming
       files to .html.
    5. Setup of authentication: PHP authentication cannot be used with any
       other authentication. ALL AUTHENTICATION IS PASSED TO YOUR PHP
       SCRIPT. To configure PHP Authentication for the entire server, add
       the following line to your default object:

<Object name="default">
AuthTrans fn=php4_auth_trans
.
.
.
</Object>

    6. To use PHP Authentication on a single directory, add the following:

<Object ppath="d:\path\to\authenticated\dir\*">
AuthTrans fn=php4_auth_trans
</Object>

     Note: The stacksize that PHP uses depends on the configuration of
     the web server. If you get crashes with very large PHP scripts, it
     is recommended to raise it with the Admin Server (in the section
     "MAGNUS EDITOR").
     __________________________________________________________________

CGI environment and recommended modifications in php.ini

   Important when writing PHP scripts is the fact that Sun JSWS/Sun ONE
   WS/iPlanet/Netscape is a multithreaded web server. Because of that all
   requests are running in the same process space (the space of the web
   server itself) and this space has only one environment. If you want to
   get CGI variables like PATH_INFO, HTTP_HOST etc. it is not the correct
   way to try this in the old PHP 3.x way with getenv() or a similar way
   (register globals to environment, $_ENV). You would only get the
   environment of the running web server without any valid CGI variables!

     Note: Why are there (invalid) CGI variables in the environment?

     Answer: This is because you started the web server process from the
     admin server which runs the startup script of the web server, you
     wanted to start, as a CGI script (a CGI script inside of the admin
     server!). This is why the environment of the started web server has
     some CGI environment variables in it. You can test this by starting
     the web server not from the administration server. Use the command
     line as root user and start it manually - you will see there are no
     CGI-like environment variables.

   Simply change your scripts to get CGI variables in the correct way for
   PHP 4.x by using the superglobal $_SERVER. If you have older scripts
   which use $HTTP_HOST, etc., you should turn on register_globals in
   php.ini and change the variable order too (important: remove "E" from
   it, because you do not need the environment here):
variables_order = "GPCS"
register_globals = On
     __________________________________________________________________

Special use for error pages or self-made directory listings (PHP >= 4.3.3)

   You can use PHP to generate the error pages for "404 Not Found" or
   similar. Add the following line to the object in obj.conf for every
   error page you want to overwrite:
Error fn="php4_execute" code=XXX script="/path/to/script.php" [inikey=value inik
ey=value...]

   where XXX is the HTTP error code. Please delete any other Error
   directives which could interfere with yours. If you want to place a
   page for all errors that could exist, leave the code parameter out.
   Your script can get the HTTP status code with $_SERVER['ERROR_TYPE'].

   Another possibility is to generate self-made directory listings. Just
   create a PHP script which displays a directory listing and replace the
   corresponding default Service line for type="magnus-internal/directory"
   in obj.conf with the following:
Service fn="php4_execute" type="magnus-internal/directory" script="/path/to/scri
pt.php" [inikey=value inikey=value...]

   For both error and directory listing pages the original URI and
   translated URI are in the variables $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'] and
   $_SERVER['PATH_TRANSLATED'].
     __________________________________________________________________

Note about nsapi_virtual() and subrequests (PHP >= 4.3.3)

   The NSAPI module now supports the nsapi_virtual() function (alias:
   virtual()) to make subrequests on the web server and insert the result
   in the web page. This function uses some undocumented features from the
   NSAPI library. On Unix the module automatically looks for the needed
   functions and uses them if available. If not, nsapi_virtual() is
   disabled.

     Note: But be warned: Support for nsapi_virtual() is EXPERIMENTAL!!!
     __________________________________________________________________

CGI and command line setups

   The default is to build PHP as a CGI program. This creates a command
   line interpreter, which can be used for CGI processing, or for
   non-web-related PHP scripting. If you are running a web server PHP has
   module support for, you should generally go for that solution for
   performance reasons. However, the CGI version enables users to run
   different PHP-enabled pages under different user-ids.

   Warning

   By using the CGI setup, your server is open to several possible
   attacks. Please read our CGI security section to learn how to defend
   yourself from those attacks.

   As of PHP 4.3.0, some important additions have happened to PHP. A new
   SAPI named CLI also exists and it has the same name as the CGI binary.
   What is installed at {PREFIX}/bin/php depends on your configure line
   and this is described in detail in the manual section named Using PHP
   from the command line. For further details please read that section of
   the manual.
     __________________________________________________________________

Testing

   If you have built PHP as a CGI program, you may test your build by
   typing make test. It is always a good idea to test your build. This way
   you may catch a problem with PHP on your platform early instead of
   having to struggle with it later.
     __________________________________________________________________

Benchmarking

   If you have built PHP 3 as a CGI program, you may benchmark your build
   by typing make bench. Note that if safe mode is on by default, the
   benchmark may not be able to finish if it takes longer then the 30
   seconds allowed. This is because the set_time_limit() can not be used
   in safe mode. Use the max_execution_time configuration setting to
   control this time for your own scripts. make bench ignores the
   configuration file.

     Note: make bench is only available for PHP 3.
     __________________________________________________________________

Using Variables

   Some server supplied environment variables are not defined in the
   current CGI/1.1 specification. Only the following variables are defined
   there: AUTH_TYPE, CONTENT_LENGTH, CONTENT_TYPE, GATEWAY_INTERFACE,
   PATH_INFO, PATH_TRANSLATED, QUERY_STRING, REMOTE_ADDR, REMOTE_HOST,
   REMOTE_IDENT, REMOTE_USER, REQUEST_METHOD, SCRIPT_NAME, SERVER_NAME,
   SERVER_PORT, SERVER_PROTOCOL, and SERVER_SOFTWARE. Everything else
   should be treated as 'vendor extensions'.

HP-UX specific installation notes

   This section contains notes and hints specific to installing PHP on
   HP-UX systems.

   There are two main options for installing PHP on HP-UX systems. Either
   compile it, or install a pre-compiled binary.

   Official pre-compiled packages are located here:
   http://software.hp.com/

   Until this manual section is rewritten, the documentation about
   compiling PHP (and related extensions) on HP-UX systems has been
   removed. For now, consider reading the following external resource:
   Building Apache and PHP on HP-UX 11.11
     __________________________________________________________________

OpenBSD installation notes

   This section contains notes and hints specific to installing PHP on
   OpenBSD 3.6.
     __________________________________________________________________

Using Binary Packages

   Using binary packages to install PHP on OpenBSD is the recommended and
   simplest method. The core package has been separated from the various
   modules, and each can be installed and removed independently from the
   others. The files you need can be found on your OpenBSD CD or on the
   FTP site.

   The main package you need to install is php4-core-4.3.8.tgz, which
   contains the basic engine (plus gettext and iconv). Next, take a look
   at the module packages, such as php4-mysql-4.3.8.tgz or
   php4-imap-4.3.8.tgz. You need to use the phpxs command to activate and
   deactivate these modules in your php.ini.

   Example 2-6. OpenBSD Package Install Example
# pkg_add php4-core-4.3.8.tgz
# /usr/local/sbin/phpxs -s
# cp /usr/local/share/doc/php4/php.ini-recommended /var/www/conf/php.ini
  (add in mysql)
# pkg_add php4-mysql-4.3.8.tgz
# /usr/local/sbin/phpxs -a mysql
  (add in imap)
# pkg_add php4-imap-4.3.8.tgz
# /usr/local/sbin/phpxs -a imap
  (remove mysql as a test)
# pkg_delete php4-mysql-4.3.8
# /usr/local/sbin/phpxs -r mysql
  (install the PEAR libraries)
# pkg_add php4-pear-4.3.8.tgz

   Read the packages(7) manual page for more information about binary
   packages on OpenBSD.
     __________________________________________________________________

Using Ports

   You can also compile up PHP from source using the ports tree. However,
   this is only recommended for users familiar with OpenBSD. The PHP 4
   port is split into two sub-directories: core and extensions. The
   extensions directory generates sub-packages for all of the supported
   PHP modules. If you find you do not want to create some of these
   modules, use the no_* FLAVOR. For example, to skip building the imap
   module, set the FLAVOR to no_imap.
     __________________________________________________________________

Common Problems

     * The default install of Apache runs inside a chroot(2) jail, which
       will restrict PHP scripts to accessing files under /var/www. You
       will therefore need to create a /var/www/tmp directory for PHP
       session files to be stored, or use an alternative session backend.
       In addition, database sockets need to be placed inside the jail or
       listen on the localhost interface. If you use network functions,
       some files from /etc such as /etc/resolv.conf and /etc/services
       will need to be moved into /var/www/etc. The OpenBSD PEAR package
       automatically installs into the correct chroot directories, so no
       special modification is needed there. More information on the
       OpenBSD Apache is available in the OpenBSD FAQ.
     * The OpenBSD 3.6 package for the gd extension requires XFree86 to be
       installed. If you do not wish to use some of the font features that
       require X11, install the php4-gd-4.3.8-no_x11.tgz package instead.
     __________________________________________________________________

Older Releases

   Older releases of OpenBSD used the FLAVORS system to compile up a
   statically linked PHP. Since it is hard to generate binary packages
   using this method, it is now deprecated. You can still use the old
   stable ports trees if you wish, but they are unsupported by the OpenBSD
   team. If you have any comments about this, the current maintainer for
   the port is Anil Madhavapeddy (avsm at openbsd dot org).

Solaris specific installation tips

   This section contains notes and hints specific to installing PHP on
   Solaris systems.
     __________________________________________________________________

Required software

   Solaris installs often lack C compilers and their related tools. Read
   this FAQ for information on why using GNU versions for some of these
   tools is necessary. The required software is as follows:

     * gcc (recommended, other C compilers may work)
     * make
     * flex
     * bison
     * m4
     * autoconf
     * automake
     * perl
     * gzip
     * tar
     * GNU sed

   In addition, you will need to install (and possibly compile) any
   additional software specific to your configuration, such as Oracle or
   MySQL.
     __________________________________________________________________

Using Packages

   You can simplify the Solaris install process by using pkgadd to install
   most of your needed components.
     __________________________________________________________________

Debian GNU/Linux installation notes

   This section contains notes and hints specific to installing PHP on
   Debian GNU/Linux.
     __________________________________________________________________

Using APT

   While you can just download the PHP source and compile it yourself,
   using Debian's packaging system is the simplest and cleanest method of
   installing PHP. If you are not familiar with building software on
   Linux, this is the way to go.

   The first decision you need to make is whether you want to install
   Apache 1.3.x or Apache 2.x. The corresponding PHP packages are
   respectively named libapache-mod-php* and libapache2-mod-php*. The
   steps given below will use Apache 1.3.x. Please note that, as of this
   writing, there is no official Debian packages of PHP 5. Then the steps
   given below will install PHP 4.

   PHP is available in Debian as CGI or CLI flavour too, named
   respectively php4-cgi and php4-cli. If you need them, you'll just have
   to reproduce the following steps with the good package names. Another
   special package you'd want to install is php4-pear. It contains a
   minimal PEAR installation and the pear commandline utility.

   If you need more recent packages of PHP than the Debian's stable ones
   or if some PHP modules lacks the Debian official repository, perhaps
   you should take a look at http://www.apt-get.org/. One of the results
   found should be Dotdeb. This unofficial repository is maintained by
   Guillaume Plessis and contains Debian packages of the most recent
   versions of PHP 4 and PHP 5. To use it, just add the to following two
   lines to your /etc/apt/sources.lists and run apt-get update :

   Example 2-7. The two Dotdeb related lines
deb http://packages.dotdeb.org stable all
deb-src http://packages.dotdeb.org stable all

   The last thing to consider is whether your list of packages is up to
   date. If you have not updated it recently, you need to run apt-get
   update before anything else. This way, you will be using the most
   recent stable version of the Apache and PHP packages.

   Now that everything is in place, you can use the following example to
   install Apache and PHP:

   Example 2-8. Debian Install Example with Apache 1.3
   # apt-get install libapache-mod-php4

   APT will automatically install the PHP 4 module for Apache 1.3, and all
   its dependencies and then activate it. If you're not asked to restart
   Apache during the install process, you'll have to do it manually :

   Example 2-9. Stopping and starting Apache once PHP 4 is installed
# /etc/init.d/apache stop
# /etc/init.d/apache start
     __________________________________________________________________

Better control on configuration

   In the last section, PHP was installed with only core modules. This may
   not be what you want and you will soon discover that you need more
   activated modules, like MySQL, cURL, GD, etc.

   When you compile PHP from source yourself, you need to activate modules
   via the configure command. With APT, you just have to install
   additional packages. They're all named 'php4-*' (or 'php5-*' if you
   installed PHP 5 from a third party repository).

   Example 2-10. Getting the list of PHP additional packages
   # dpkg -l 'php4-*'

   As you can see from the last output, there's a lot of PHP modules that
   you can install (excluding the php4-cgi, php4-cli or php4-pear special
   packages). Look at them closely and choose what you need. If you choose
   a module and you do not have the proper libraries, APT will
   automatically install all the dependencies for you.

   If you choose to add the MySQL, cURL and GD support to PHP the command
   will look something like this:

   Example 2-11. Install PHP with MySQL, cURL and GD
   # apt-get install php4-mysql php4-curl php4-gd

   APT will automatically add the appropriate lines to your different
   php.ini (/etc/php4/apache/php.ini, /etc/php4/cgi/php.ini, etc).

   Example 2-12. These lines activate MySQL, cURL and GD into PHP
extension=mysql.so
extension=curl.so
extension=gd.so

   You'll only have to stop/start Apache as previously to activate the
   modules.
     __________________________________________________________________

Common Problems

     * If you see the PHP source instead of the result the script should
       produce, APT has probably not included /etc/apache/conf.d/php4 in
       your Apache 1.3 configuration. Please ensure that the following
       line is present in your /etc/apache/httpd.conf file then stop/start
       Apache:

   Example 2-13. This line activates PHP 4 into Apache
# Include /etc/apache/conf.d/

     * If you installed an additional module and if its functions are not
       available in your scripts, please ensure that the appropriate line
       is present in your php.ini, as seen before. APT may fail during the
       installation of the additional module, due to a confusing debconf
       configuration.

Chapter 3. Installation on Mac OS X

   This section contains notes and hints specific to installing PHP on Mac
   OS X. There are two slightly different versions of Mac OS X, Client and
   Server, our manual deals with installing PHP on both systems. Note that
   PHP is not available for MacOS 9 and earlier versions.
     __________________________________________________________________

Using Packages

   There are a few pre-packaged and pre-compiled versions of PHP for Mac
   OS X. This can help in setting up a standard configuration, but if you
   need to have a different set of features (such as a secure server, or a
   different database driver), you may need to build PHP and/or your web
   server yourself. If you are unfamiliar with building and compiling your
   own software, it's worth checking whether somebody has already built a
   packaged version of PHP with the features you need.

   The following resources offer easy to install packages and precompiled
   binaries for PHP on Mac OS:

     * Darwin: http://darwinports.opendarwin.org/
     * Entropy: http://www.entropy.ch/software/macosx/php/
     * Fink: http://fink.sourceforge.net/
     __________________________________________________________________

Using the bundled PHP

   PHP has come standard with Macs since OS X version 10.0.0. Enabling PHP
   with the default web server requires uncommenting a few lines in the
   Apache configuration file httpd.conf whereas the CGI and/or CLI are
   enabled by default (easily accessible via the Terminal program).

   Enabling PHP using the instructions below is meant for quickly setting
   up a local development environment. It's highly recommended to always
   upgrade PHP to the newest version. Like most live software, newer
   versions are created to fix bugs and add features and PHP being is no
   different. See the appropriate MAC OS X installation documentation for
   further details. The following instructions are geared towards a
   beginner with details provided for getting a default setup to work. All
   users are encouraged to compile, or install a new packaged version.

   The standard installation type is using mod_php, and enabling the
   bundled mod_php on Mac OS X for the Apache web server (the default web
   server, that is accessible via System Preferences) involves the
   following steps:

    1. Locate and open the Apache configuration file. By default, the
       location is as follows: /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
       Using Finder or Spotlight to find this file may prove difficult as
       by default it's private and owned by the root user.

     Note: One way to open this is by using a Unix based text editor in
     the Terminal, for example nano, and because the file is owned by
     root we'll use the sudo command to open it (as root) so for example
     type the following into the Terminal Application (after, it will
     prompt for a password): sudo nano /etc/httpd/httpd.conf
     Noteworthy nano commands: ^w (search), ^o (save), and ^x (exit)
     where ^ represents the Ctrl key.
    2. With a text editor, uncomment the lines (by removing the #) that
       look similar to the following (these two lines are often not
       together, locate them both in the file):

# LoadModule php4_module libexec/httpd/libphp4.so

# AddModule mod_php4.c

       Notice the location/path. When building PHP in the future, the
       above files should be replaced or commented out.
    3. Be sure the desired extensions will parse as PHP (examples: .php
       .html and .inc)
       Due to the following statement already existing in httpd.conf (as
       of Mac Panther), once PHP is enabled the .php files will
       automatically parse as PHP.

<IfModule mod_php4.c>
    # If php is turned on, we respect .php and .phps files.
    AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
    AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

    # Since most users will want index.php to work we
    # also automatically enable index.php
    <IfModule mod_dir.c>
        DirectoryIndex index.html index.php
    </IfModule>
</IfModule>

    4. Be sure the DirectoryIndex loads the desired default index file
       This is also set in httpd.conf. Typically index.php and index.html
       are used. By default index.php is enabled because it's also in the
       PHP check shown above. Adjust accordingly.
    5. Set the php.ini location or use the default
       A typical default location on Mac OS X is /usr/local/php/php.ini
       and a call to phpinfo() will reveal this information. If a php.ini
       is not used, PHP will use all default values. See also the related
       FAQ on finding php.ini.
    6. Locate or set the DocumentRoot
       This is the root directory for all the web files. Files in this
       directory are served from the web server so the PHP files will
       parse as PHP before outputting them to the browser. A typical
       default path is /Library/WebServer/Documents but this can be set to
       anything in httpd.conf. Alternatively, the default DocumentRoot for
       individual users is /Users/yourusername/Sites
    7. Create a phpinfo() file
       The phpinfo() function will display information about PHP. Consider
       creating a file in the DocumentRoot with the following PHP code:

<?php phpinfo(); ?>

    8. Restart Apache, and load the PHP file created above
       To restart, either execute sudo apachectl graceful in the shell or
       stop/start the "Personal Web Server" option in the OS X System
       Preferences. By default, loading local files in the browser will
       have an URL like so: http://localhost/info.php Or using the
       DocumentRoot in the user directory is another option and would end
       up looking like: http://localhost/~yourusername/info.php

   The CLI (or CGI in older versions) is appropriately named php and
   likely exists as /usr/bin/php. Open up the terminal, read the command
   line section of the PHP manual, and execute php -v to check the PHP
   version of this PHP binary. A call to phpinfo() will also reveal this
   information.
     __________________________________________________________________

Compiling for OS X Server

   Mac OS X Server install.

    1. Get the latest distributions of Apache and PHP.
    2. Untar them, and run the configure program on Apache like so.

./configure --exec-prefix=/usr \
--localstatedir=/var \
--mandir=/usr/share/man \
--libexecdir=/System/Library/Apache/Modules \
--iconsdir=/System/Library/Apache/Icons \
--includedir=/System/Library/Frameworks/Apache.framework/Versions/1.3/Headers \
--enable-shared=max \
--enable-module=most \
--target=apache

    3. If you want the compiler to do some optimization, you may also want
       to add this line:

setenv OPTIM=-O2

    4. Next, go to the PHP 4 source directory and configure it.

./configure --prefix=/usr \
    --sysconfdir=/etc \
    --localstatedir=/var \
    --mandir=/usr/share/man \
    --with-xml \
    --with-apache=/src/apache_1.3.12

       If you have any other additions (MySQL, GD, etc.), be sure to add
       them here. For the --with-apache string, put in the path to your
       apache source directory, for example /src/apache_1.3.12.
    5. Type make and make install. This will add a directory to your
       Apache source directory under src/modules/php4.
    6. Now, reconfigure Apache to build in PHP 4.

./configure --exec-prefix=/usr \
--localstatedir=/var \
--mandir=/usr/share/man \
--libexecdir=/System/Library/Apache/Modules \
--iconsdir=/System/Library/Apache/Icons \
--includedir=/System/Library/Frameworks/Apache.framework/Versions/1.3/Headers \
--enable-shared=max \
--enable-module=most \
--target=apache \
--activate-module=src/modules/php4/libphp4.a

       You may get a message telling you that libmodphp4.a is out of date.
       If so, go to the src/modules/php4 directory inside your Apache
       source directory and run this command: ranlib libmodphp4.a. Then go
       back to the root of the Apache source directory and run the above
       configure command again. That'll bring the link table up to date.
       Run make and make install again.
    7. Copy and rename the php.ini-dist file to your bin directory from
       your PHP 4 source directory: cp php.ini-dist /usr/local/bin/php.ini
       or (if your don't have a local directory) cp php.ini-dist
       /usr/bin/php.ini.

Compiling for MacOS X Client

   The following instructions will help you install a PHP module for the
   Apache web server included in MacOS X. This version includes support
   for the MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. These instructions are
   graciously provided by Marc Liyanage.

   Warning

   Be careful when you do this, you could screw up your Apache web server!

   Do this to install:

    1. Open a terminal window.
    2. Type wget
       http://www.diax.ch/users/liyanage/software/macosx/libphp4.so.gz,
       wait for the download to finish.
    3. Type gunzip libphp4.so.gz.
    4. Type sudo apxs -i -a -n php4 libphp4.so
    5. Now type sudo open -a TextEdit /etc/httpd/httpd.conf. TextEdit will
       open with the web server configuration file. Locate these two lines
       towards the end of the file: (Use the Find command)

#AddType application/x-httpd-php .php
#AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps

       Remove the two hash marks (#), then save the file and quit
       TextEdit.
    6. Finally, type sudo apachectl graceful to restart the web server.

   PHP should now be up and running. You can test it by dropping a file
   into your Sites folder which is called test.php. Into that file, write
   this line: <?php phpinfo() ?>.

   Now open up 127.0.0.1/~your_username/test.php in your web browser. You
   should see a status table with information about the PHP module.

Chapter 4. Installation of PECL extensions

Introduction to PECL Installations

   PECL is a repository of PHP extensions that are made available to you
   via the PEAR packaging system. This section of the manual is intended
   to demonstrate how to obtain and install PECL extensions.

   These instructions assume /your/phpsrcdir/ is the path to the PHP
   source distribution, and that extname is the name of the PECL
   extension. Adjust accordingly. These instructions also assume a
   familiarity with the pear command. The information in the PEAR manual
   for the pear command also applies to the pecl command.

   To be useful, a shared extension must be built, installed, and loaded.
   The methods described below provide you with various instructions on
   how to build and install the extensions, but they do not automatically
   load them. Extensions can be loaded by adding an extension directive.
   To this php.ini file, or through the use of the dl() function.

   When building PHP modules, it's important to have known-good versions
   of the required tools (autoconf, automake, libtool, etc.) See the
   SVN Instructions for details on the required tools, and required
   versions.
     __________________________________________________________________

Downloading PECL extensions

   There are several options for downloading PECL extensions, such as:

     * http://pecl.php.net
       The PECL web site contains information about the different
       extensions that are offered by the PHP Development Team. The
       information available here includes: ChangeLog, release notes,
       requirements and other similar details.
     * pecl download extname
       PECL extensions that have releases listed on the PECL web site are
       available for download and installation using the pecl command.
       Specific revisions may also be specified.
     * SVN
       All PECL files reside in SVN. A web-based view may be seen at
       http://svn.php.net/pecl/. To download straight from SVN, use:

$ svn co http://svn.php.net/repository/pecl/<extname>/trunk <extname>

     * Windows downloads
       Windows users may find compiled PECL binaries by downloading the
       Collection of PECL modules from the PHP Downloads page, or by
       retrieving a PECL Snapshot or an extension DLL on PECL4WIN. To
       compile PHP under Windows, read the appropriate chapter.
     __________________________________________________________________

PECL for Windows users

   As with any other PHP extension DLL, installation is as simple as
   copying the PECL extension DLLs into the extension_dir folder and
   loading them from php.ini. For example, add the following line to your
   php.ini:

   extension=php_extname.dll

   After doing this, restart the web server.
     __________________________________________________________________

Compiling shared PECL extensions with the pecl command

   PECL makes it easy to create shared PHP extensions. Using the pecl
   command, do the following:

   $ pecl install extname

   This will download the source for extname, compile, and install
   extname.so into your extension_dir. extname.so may then be loaded via
   php.ini

   By default, the pecl command will not install packages that are marked
   with the alpha or beta state. If no stable packages are available, you
   may install a beta package using the following command:

   $ pecl install extname-beta

   You may also install a specific version using this variant:

   $ pecl install extname-0.1
     __________________________________________________________________

Compiling shared PECL extensions with phpize

   Sometimes, using the pecl installer is not an option. This could be
   because you're behind a firewall, or it could be because the extension
   you want to install is not available as a PECL compatible package, such
   as unreleased extensions from SVN. If you need to build such an
   extension, you can use the lower-level build tools to perform the build
   manually.

   The phpize command is used to prepare the build environment for a PHP
   extension. In the following sample, the sources for an extension are in
   a directory named extname:

$ cd extname
$ phpize
$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

   A successful install will have created extname.so and put it into the
   PHP extensions directory. You'll need to and adjust php.ini and add an
   extension=extname.so line before you can use the extension.

   If the system is missing the phpize command, and precompiled packages
   (like RPM's) are used, be sure to also install the appropriate devel
   version of the PHP package as they often include the phpize command
   along with the appropriate header files to build PHP and its
   extensions.

   Execute phpize --help to display additional usage information.
     __________________________________________________________________

Compiling PECL extensions statically into PHP

   You might find that you need to build a PECL extension statically into
   your PHP binary. To do this, you'll need to place the extension source
   under the php-src/ext/ directory and tell the PHP build system to
   regenerate its configure script.

$ cd /your/phpsrcdir/ext
$ pecl download extname
$ gzip -d < extname.tgz | tar -xvf -
$ mv extname-x.x.x extname

   This will result in the following directory:

   /your/phpsrcdir/ext/extname

   From here, force PHP to rebuild the configure script, and then build
   PHP as normal:

$ cd /your/phpsrcdir
$ rm configure
$ ./buildconf --force
$ ./configure --help
$ ./configure --with-extname --enable-someotherext --with-foobar
$ make
$ make install

     Note: To run the 'buildconf' script you need autoconf 2.13 and
     automake 1.4+ (newer versions of autoconf may work, but are not
     supported).

   Whether --enable-extname or --with-extname is used depends on the
   extension. Typically an extension that does not require external
   libraries uses --enable. To be sure, run the following after buildconf:

   $ ./configure --help | grep extname

Chapter 5. Problems?

Read the FAQ

   Some problems are more common than others. The most common ones are
   listed in the PHP FAQ, part of this manual.
     __________________________________________________________________

Other problems

   If you are still stuck, someone on the PHP installation mailing list
   may be able to help you. You should check out the archive first, in
   case someone already answered someone else who had the same problem as
   you. The archives are available from the support page on
   http://www.php.net/support.php. To subscribe to the PHP installation
   mailing list, send an empty mail to
   php-install-subscribe@lists.php.net. The mailing list address is
   php-install@lists.php.net.

   If you want to get help on the mailing list, please try to be precise
   and give the necessary details about your environment (which operating
   system, what PHP version, what web server, if you are running PHP as
   CGI or a server module, safe mode, etc...), and preferably enough code
   to make others able to reproduce and test your problem.
     __________________________________________________________________

Bug reports

   If you think you have found a bug in PHP, please report it. The PHP
   developers probably don't know about it, and unless you report it,
   chances are it won't be fixed. You can report bugs using the
   bug-tracking system at http://bugs.php.net/. Please do not send bug
   reports in mailing list or personal letters. The bug system is also
   suitable to submit feature requests.

   Read the How to report a bug document before submitting any bug
   reports!
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 6. Runtime Configuration

The configuration file

   The configuration file (called php3.ini in PHP 3, and simply php.ini as
   of PHP 4) is read when PHP starts up. For the server module versions of
   PHP, this happens only once when the web server is started. For the CGI
   and CLI version, it happens on every invocation.

   php.ini is searched in these locations (in order):

     * SAPI module specific location (PHPIniDir directive in Apache 2, -c
       command line option in CGI and CLI, php_ini parameter in NSAPI,
       PHP_INI_PATH environment variable in THTTPD)
     * The PHPRC environment variable. Before PHP 5.2.0 this was checked
       after the registry key mentioned below.
     * As of PHP 5.2.0, the following registry locations are searched in
       order: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PHP\x.y.z\IniFilePath,
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PHP\x.y\IniFilePath and
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PHP\x\IniFilePath, where x, y and z
       mean the PHP major, minor and release versions.
     * HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PHP\IniFilePath (Windows Registry
       location)
     * Current working directory (except CLI)
     * The web server's directory (for SAPI modules), or directory of PHP
       (otherwise in Windows)
     * Windows directory (C:\windows or C:\winnt) (for Windows), or
       --with-config-file-path compile time option

   If php-SAPI.ini exists (where SAPI is used SAPI, so the filename is
   e.g. php-cli.ini or php-apache.ini), it's used instead of php.ini. SAPI
   name can be determined by php_sapi_name().

     Note: The Apache web server changes the directory to root at startup
     causing PHP to attempt to read php.ini from the root filesystem if
     it exists.

   The php.ini directives handled by extensions are documented
   respectively on the pages of the extensions themselves. The list of the
   core directives is available in the appendix. Probably not all PHP
   directives are documented in the manual though. For a complete list of
   directives available in your PHP version, please read your well
   commented php.ini file. Alternatively, you may find the the latest
   php.ini from SVN helpful too.

   Example 6-1. php.ini example
; any text on a line after an unquoted semicolon (;) is ignored
[php] ; section markers (text within square brackets) are also ignored
; Boolean values can be set to either:
;    true, on, yes
; or false, off, no, none
register_globals = off
track_errors = yes

; you can enclose strings in double-quotes
include_path = ".:/usr/local/lib/php"

; backslashes are treated the same as any other character
include_path = ".;c:\php\lib"

   Since PHP 5.1.0, it is possible to refer to existing .ini variables
   from within .ini files. Example: open_basedir = ${open_basedir}
   ":/new/dir".
     __________________________________________________________________

How to change configuration settings

Running PHP as an Apache module

   When using PHP as an Apache module, you can also change the
   configuration settings using directives in Apache configuration files
   (e.g. httpd.conf) and .htaccess files. You will need "AllowOverride
   Options" or "AllowOverride All" privileges to do so.

   With PHP 4 and PHP 5, there are several Apache directives that allow
   you to change the PHP configuration from within the Apache
   configuration files. For a listing of which directives are PHP_INI_ALL,
   PHP_INI_PERDIR, or PHP_INI_SYSTEM, have a look at the List of php.ini
   directives appendix.

     Note: With PHP 3, there are Apache directives that correspond to
     each configuration setting in the php3.ini name, except the name is
     prefixed by "php3_".

   php_value name value
          Sets the value of the specified directive. Can be used only with
          PHP_INI_ALL and PHP_INI_PERDIR type directives. To clear a
          previously set value use none as the value.

     Note: Don't use php_value to set boolean values. php_flag (see
     below) should be used instead.

   php_flag name on|off
          Used to set a boolean configuration directive. Can be used only
          with PHP_INI_ALL and PHP_INI_PERDIR type directives.

   php_admin_value name value
          Sets the value of the specified directive. This can not be used
          in .htaccess files. Any directive type set with php_admin_value
          can not be overridden by .htaccess or virtualhost directives. To
          clear a previously set value use none as the value.

   php_admin_flag name on|off
          Used to set a boolean configuration directive. This can not be
          used in .htaccess files. Any directive type set with
          php_admin_flag can not be overridden by .htaccess or virtualhost
          directives.

   Example 6-2. Apache configuration example
<IfModule mod_php5.c>
  php_value include_path ".:/usr/local/lib/php"
  php_admin_flag safe_mode on
</IfModule>
<IfModule mod_php4.c>
  php_value include_path ".:/usr/local/lib/php"
  php_admin_flag safe_mode on
</IfModule>
<IfModule mod_php3.c>
  php3_include_path ".:/usr/local/lib/php"
  php3_safe_mode on
</IfModule>

   Caution

   PHP constants do not exist outside of PHP. For example, in httpd.conf
   you can not use PHP constants such as E_ALL or E_NOTICE to set the
   error_reporting directive as they will have no meaning and will
   evaluate to 0. Use the associated bitmask values instead. These
   constants can be used in php.ini
     __________________________________________________________________

Changing PHP configuration via the Windows registry

   When running PHP on Windows, the configuration values can be modified
   on a per-directory basis using the Windows registry. The configuration
   values are stored in the registry key HKLM\SOFTWARE\PHP\Per Directory
   Values, in the sub-keys corresponding to the path names. For example,
   configuration values for the directory c:\inetpub\wwwroot would be
   stored in the key HKLM\SOFTWARE\PHP\Per Directory
   Values\c\inetpub\wwwroot. The settings for the directory would be
   active for any script running from this directory or any subdirectory
   of it. The values under the key should have the name of the PHP
   configuration directive and the string value. PHP constants in the
   values are not parsed. However, only configuration values changeable in
   PHP_INI_USER can be set this way, PHP_INI_PERDIR values can not.
     __________________________________________________________________

Other interfaces to PHP

   Regardless of how you run PHP, you can change certain values at runtime
   of your scripts through ini_set(). See the documentation on the
   ini_set() page for more information.

   If you are interested in a complete list of configuration settings on
   your system with their current values, you can execute the phpinfo()
   function, and review the resulting page. You can also access the values
   of individual configuration directives at runtime using ini_get() or
   get_cfg_var().
     __________________________________________________________________

Chapter 7. Installation FAQ

   This section holds common questions about the way to install PHP. PHP
   is available for almost any OS (except maybe for MacOS before OSX), and
   almost any web server.

   To install PHP, follow the instructions in Installing PHP.

   1. Why shouldn't I use Apache2 with a threaded MPM in a production
          environment?

   2. Unix/Windows: Where should my php.ini file be located?
   3. Unix: I installed PHP, but every time I load a document, I get the
          message 'Document Contains No Data'! What's going on here?

   4. Unix: I installed PHP using RPMS, but Apache isn't processing the
          PHP pages! What's going on here?

   5. Unix: I installed PHP 3 using RPMS, but it doesn't compile with the
          database support I need! What's going on here?

   6. Unix: I patched Apache with the FrontPage extensions patch, and
          suddenly PHP stopped working. Is PHP incompatible with the
          Apache FrontPage extensions?

   7. Unix/Windows: I have installed PHP, but when I try to access a PHP
          script file via my browser, I get a blank screen.

   8. Unix/Windows: I have installed PHP, but when try to access a PHP
          script file via my browser, I get a server 500 error.

   9. Some operating systems: I have installed PHP without errors, but
          when I try to start apache I get undefined symbol errors:

[mybox:user /src/php4] root# apachectl configtest
 apachectl: /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd Undefined symbols:
  _compress
  _uncompress

   10. Windows: I have installed PHP, but when I to access a PHP script
          file via my browser, I get the error:

cgi error:
 The specified CGI application misbehaved by not
 returning a complete set of HTTP headers.
 The headers it did return are:

   11. Windows: I've followed all the instructions, but still can't get
          PHP and IIS to work together!

   12. When running PHP as CGI with IIS, PWS, OmniHTTPD or Xitami, I get
          the following error: Security Alert! PHP CGI cannot be accessed
          directly..

   13. How do I know if my php.ini is being found and read? It seems like
          it isn't as my changes aren't being implemented.

   14. How do I add my PHP directory to the PATH on Windows?
   15. How do I make the php.ini file available to PHP on windows?
   16. Is it possible to use Apache content negotiation (MultiViews
          option) with PHP?

   17. Is PHP limited to process GET and POST request methods only?

   1. Why shouldn't I use Apache2 with a threaded MPM in a production
   environment?

   PHP is glue. It is the glue used to build cool web applications by
   sticking dozens of 3rd-party libraries together and making it all
   appear as one coherent entity through an intuitive and easy to learn
   language interface. The flexibility and power of PHP relies on the
   stability and robustness of the underlying platform. It needs a working
   OS, a working web server and working 3rd-party libraries to glue
   together. When any of these stop working PHP needs ways to identify the
   problems and fix them quickly. When you make the underlying framework
   more complex by not having completely separate execution threads,
   completely separate memory segments and a strong sandbox for each
   request to play in, feet of clay are introduced into PHP's system.

   If you feel you have to use a threaded MPM, look at a FastCGI
   configuration where PHP is running in its own memory space.

   And finally, this warning against using a threaded MPM is not as strong
   for Windows systems because most libraries on that platform tend to be
   threadsafe.

   2. Unix/Windows: Where should my php.ini file be located?

   By default on Unix it should be in /usr/local/lib which is
   <install-path>/lib. Most people will want to change this at
   compile-time with the --with-config-file-path flag. You would, for
   example, set it with something like:
   --with-config-file-path=/etc

   And then you would copy php.ini-dist from the distribution to
   /etc/php.ini and edit it to make any local changes you want.
   --with-config-file-scan-dir=PATH

   On Windows the default path for the php.ini file is the Windows
   directory. If you're using the Apache webserver, php.ini is first
   searched in the Apaches install directory, e.g. c:\program files\apache
   group\apache. This way you can have different php.ini files for
   different versions of Apache on the same machine.

   See also the chapter about the configuration file.

   3. Unix: I installed PHP, but every time I load a document, I get the
   message 'Document Contains No Data'! What's going on here?

   This probably means that PHP is having some sort of problem and is
   core-dumping. Look in your server error log to see if this is the case,
   and then try to reproduce the problem with a small test case. If you
   know how to use 'gdb', it is very helpful when you can provide a
   backtrace with your bug report to help the developers pinpoint the
   problem. If you are using PHP as an Apache module try something like:

     * Stop your httpd processes
     * gdb httpd
     * Stop your httpd processes
     * > run -X -f /path/to/httpd.conf
     * Then fetch the URL causing the problem with your browser
     * > run -X -f /path/to/httpd.conf
     * If you are getting a core dump, gdb should inform you of this now
     * type: bt
     * You should include your backtrace in your bug report. This should
       be submitted to http://bugs.php.net/

   If your script uses the regular expression functions (ereg() and
   friends), you should make sure that you compiled PHP and Apache with
   the same regular expression package. This should happen automatically
   with PHP and Apache 1.3.x

   4. Unix: I installed PHP using RPMS, but Apache isn't processing the
   PHP pages! What's going on here?

   Assuming you installed both Apache and PHP from RPM packages, you need
   to uncomment or add some or all of the following lines in your
   httpd.conf file:
# Extra Modules
AddModule mod_php.c
AddModule mod_php3.c
AddModule mod_perl.c

# Extra Modules
LoadModule php_module         modules/mod_php.so
LoadModule php3_module        modules/libphp3.so     # for PHP 3
LoadModule php4_module        modules/libphp4.so     # for PHP 4
LoadModule perl_module        modules/libperl.so

   And add:
AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3    # for PHP 3
AddType application/x-httpd-php .php      # for PHP 4

   ... to the global properties, or to the properties of the VirtualDomain
   you want to have PHP support added to.

   5. Unix: I installed PHP 3 using RPMS, but it doesn't compile with the
   database support I need! What's going on here?

   Due to the way PHP 3 built, it is not easy to build a complete flexible
   PHP RPM. This issue is addressed in PHP 4. For PHP 3, we currently
   suggest you use the mechanism described in the INSTALL.REDHAT file in
   the PHP distribution. If you insist on using an RPM version of PHP 3,
   read on...

   The RPM packagers are setting up the RPMS to install without database
   support to simplify installations and because RPMS use /usr/ instead of
   the standard /usr/local/ directory for files. You need to tell the RPM
   spec file which databases to support and the location of the top-level
   of your database server.

   This example will explain the process of adding support for the popular
   MySQL database server, using the mod installation for Apache.

   Of course all of this information can be adjusted for any database
   server that PHP supports. We will assume you installed MySQL and Apache
   completely with RPMS for this example as well.

     * First remove mod_php3 :

rpm -e mod_php3

     * Then get the source rpm and INSTALL it, NOT --rebuild

rpm -Uvh mod_php3-3.0.5-2.src.rpm

     * Then edit the /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/mod_php3.spec file
       In the %build section add the database support you want, and the
       path.
       For MySQL you would add --with-mysql=/usr The %build section will
       look something like this:

./configure --prefix=/usr \
--with-apxs=/usr/sbin/apxs \
--with-config-file-path=/usr/lib \
--enable-debug=no \
--enable-safe-mode \
--with-exec-dir=/usr/bin \
--with-mysql=/usr \
--with-system-regex

     * Once this modification is made then build the binary rpm as
       follows:

rpm -bb /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/mod_php3.spec

     * Then install the rpm

rpm -ivh /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/mod_php3-3.0.5-2.i386.rpm

   Make sure you restart Apache, and you now have PHP 3 with MySQL support
   using RPM's. Note that it is probably much easier to just build from
   the distribution tarball of PHP 3 and follow the instructions in
   INSTALL.REDHAT found in that distribution.

   6. Unix: I patched Apache with the FrontPage extensions patch, and
   suddenly PHP stopped working. Is PHP incompatible with the Apache
   FrontPage extensions?

   No, PHP works fine with the FrontPage extensions. The problem is that
   the FrontPage patch modifies several Apache structures, that PHP relies
   on. Recompiling PHP (using 'make clean ; make') after the FP patch is
   applied would solve the problem.

   7. Unix/Windows: I have installed PHP, but when I try to access a PHP
   script file via my browser, I get a blank screen.

   Do a 'view source' in the web browser and you will probably find that
   you can see the source code of your PHP script. This means that the web
   server did not send the script to PHP for interpretation. Something is
   wrong with the server configuration - double check the server
   configuration against the PHP installation instructions.

   8. Unix/Windows: I have installed PHP, but when try to access a PHP
   script file via my browser, I get a server 500 error.

   Something went wrong when the server tried to run PHP. To get to see a
   sensible error message, from the command line, change to the directory
   containing the PHP executable (php.exe on Windows) and run php -i. If
   PHP has any problems running, then a suitable error message will be
   displayed which will give you a clue as to what needs to be done next.
   If you get a screen full of HTML codes (the output of the phpinfo()
   function) then PHP is working, and your problem may be related to your
   server configuration which you should double check.

   9. Some operating systems: I have installed PHP without errors, but
   when I try to start apache I get undefined symbol errors:
[mybox:user /src/php4] root# apachectl configtest
 apachectl: /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd Undefined symbols:
  _compress
  _uncompress

   This has actually nothing to do with PHP, but with the MySQL client
   libraries. Some need --with-zlib, others do not. This is also covered
   in the MySQL FAQ.

   10. Windows: I have installed PHP, but when I to access a PHP script
   file via my browser, I get the error:
cgi error:
 The specified CGI application misbehaved by not
 returning a complete set of HTTP headers.
 The headers it did return are:

   This error message means that PHP failed to output anything at all. To
   get to see a sensible error message, from the command line, change to
   the directory containing the PHP executable (php.exe on Windows) and
   run php -i. If PHP has any problems running, then a suitable error
   message will be displayed which will give you a clue as to what needs
   to be done next. If you get a screen full of HTML codes (the output of
   the phpinfo() function) then PHP is working.

   Once PHP is working at the command line, try accessing the script via
   the browser again. If it still fails then it could be one of the
   following:

     * File permissions on your PHP script, php.exe, php4ts.dll, php.ini
       or any PHP extensions you are trying to load are such that the
       anonymous internet user ISUR_<machinename> cannot access them.
     * The script file does not exist (or possibly isn't where you think
       it is relative to your web root directory). Note that for IIS you
       can trap this error by ticking the 'check file exists' box when
       setting up the script mappings in the Internet Services Manager. If
       a script file does not exist then the server will return a 404
       error instead. There is also the additional benefit that IIS will
       do any authentication required for you based on the NTLanMan
       permissions on your script file.

   11. Windows: I've followed all the instructions, but still can't get
   PHP and IIS to work together!

   Make sure any user who needs to run a PHP script has the rights to run
   php.exe! IIS uses an anonymous user which is added at the time IIS is
   installed. This user needs rights to php.exe. Also, any authenticated
   user will also need rights to execute php.exe. And for IIS4 you need to
   tell it that PHP is a script engine. Also, you will want to read this
   faq.

   12. When running PHP as CGI with IIS, PWS, OmniHTTPD or Xitami, I get
   the following error: Security Alert! PHP CGI cannot be accessed
   directly..

   You must set the cgi.force_redirect directive to 0. It defaults to 1 so
   be sure the directive isn't commented out (with a ;). Like all
   directives, this is set in php.ini

   Because the default is 1, it's critical that you're 100% sure that the
   correct php.ini file is being read. Read this faq for details.

   13. How do I know if my php.ini is being found and read? It seems like
   it isn't as my changes aren't being implemented.

   To be sure your php.ini is being read by PHP, make a call to phpinfo()
   and near the top will be a listing called Configuration File (php.ini).
   This will tell you where PHP is looking for php.ini and whether or not
   it's being read. If just a directory PATH exists than it's not being
   read and you should put your php.ini in that directory. If php.ini is
   included within the PATH than it is being read.

   If php.ini is being read and you're running PHP as a module, then be
   sure to restart your web server after making changes to php.ini

   14. How do I add my PHP directory to the PATH on Windows?

   On Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003:

     * Go to Control Panel and open the System icon (Start -> Settings ->
       Control Panel -> System, or just Start -> Control Panel -> System
       for Windows XP/2003)
     * Go to the Advanced tab
     * Click on the 'Environment Variables' button
     * Look into the 'System Variables' pane
     * Find the Path entry (you may need to scroll to find it)
     * Double click on the Path entry
     * Enter your PHP directory at the end, including ';' before (e.g.
       ;C:\php)
     * Press OK and restart your computer

   On Windows 98/Me you need to edit the autoexec.bat file:

     * Open the Notepad (Start -> Run and enter notepad)
     * Open the C:\autoexec.bat file
     * Locate the line with PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND;..... and
       add: ;C:\php to the end of the line
     * Save the file and restart your computer

     Note: Be sure to reboot after following the steps above to ensure
     that the PATH changes are applied.

   The PHP manual used to promote the copying of files into the Windows
   system directory, this is because this directory (C:\Windows, C:\WINNT,
   etc.) is by default in the systems PATH. Copying files into the Windows
   system directory has long since been deprecated and may cause problems.

   15. How do I make the php.ini file available to PHP on windows?

   There are several ways of doing this. If you are using Apache, read
   their installation specific instructions (Apache 1, Apache 2),
   otherwise you must set the PHPRC environment variable:

   On Windows NT, 2000, XP and 2003:

     * Go to Control Panel and open the System icon (Start -> Settings ->
       Control Panel -> System, or just Start -> Control Panel -> System
       for Windows XP/2003)
     * Go to the Advanced tab
     * Click on the 'Environment Variables' button
     * Look into the 'System variables' pane
     * Click on 'New' and enter 'PHPRC' as the variable name and the
       directory where php.ini is located as the variable value (e.g.
       C:\php)
     * Press OK and restart your computer

   On Windows 98/Me you need to edit the autoexec.bat file:

     * Open the Notepad (Start -> Run and enter notepad)
     * Open the C:\autoexec.bat file
     * Add a new line to the end of the file: set PHPRC=C:\php (replace
       C:\php with the directory where php.ini is located). Please note
       that the path cannot contain spaces. For instance, if you have
       installed PHP in C:\Program Files\PHP, you would enter
       C:\PROGRA~1\PHP instead.
     * Save the file and restart your computer

   16. Is it possible to use Apache content negotiation (MultiViews
   option) with PHP?

   If links to PHP files include extension, everything works perfect. This
   FAQ is only for the case when links to PHP files don't include
   extension and you want to use content negotiation to choose PHP files
   from URL with no extension. In this case, replace the line AddType
   application/x-httpd-php .php with:
# PHP 4
AddHandler php-script php
AddType text/html php

# PHP 5
AddHandler php5-script php
AddType text/html php

   This solution doesn't work for Apache 1 as PHP module doesn't catch
   php-script.

   17. Is PHP limited to process GET and POST request methods only?

   No, it is possible to handle any request method, e.g. CONNECT. Proper
   response status can be sent with header(). If only GET and POST methods
   should be handled, it can be achieved with this Apache configuration:
<LimitExcept GET POST>
Deny from all
</LimitExcept>

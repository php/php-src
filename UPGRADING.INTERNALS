PHP 8.4 INTERNALS UPGRADE NOTES

1. Internal API changes

2. Build system changes

3. Module changes

4. OpCode changes

5. SAPI changes

========================
1. Internal API changes
========================

* zend_register_module_ex() now takes an additional int module_type argument.
  This function will also assign the module number and type, there is no need
  to do this at the call site anymore. Writing the handle should happen after
  successful registration.

* ZPP now accepts a F or Z_PARAM_FUNC_NO_TRAMPOLINE_FREE type check.
  This is identical to the 'f' or Z_PARAM_FUNC type check, except the FCC is
  always initialized because it doesn't free trampolines.
  Trampolines MUST be freed using zend_release_fcall_info_cache() or consumed.

========================
2. Build system changes
========================

 a. Unix build system changes
   - The configure option --with-zlib-dir has been removed.
   - Symbol COOKIE_IO_FUNCTIONS_T has been removed (use cookie_io_functions_t).

========================
3. Module changes
========================

 a. ext/dom
   - dom_read_t and dom_write_t now expect the function to return zend_result
     instead of int.
   - The macros DOM_NO_ARGS() and DOM_NOT_IMPLEMENTED() have been removed.

 b. ext/random
   - The macro RAND_RANGE_BADSCALING() has been removed. The implementation
     should either be inlined and undefined behavior fixed or it should be
     replaced by a non-biased scaler.

========================
4. OpCode changes
========================

========================
5. SAPI changes
========================

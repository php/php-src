PHP 8.2 INTERNALS UPGRADE NOTES

1. Internal API changes

2. Build system changes

3. Module changes

4. OpCode changes

5. SAPI changes

========================
1. Internal API changes
========================

* Removed zend_binary_zval_str(n)casecmp() APIs. These were thin wrappers
  around zend_binary_str(n)casecmp_l() -- rather than
  zend_binary_str(n)casecmp() as one would expect. Call the appropriate
  wrapped function directly instead.
* Removed the (ZEND_)WRONG_PARAM_COUNT_WITH_RETVAL() macros.
* php_stristr() no longer lowercases the haystack and needle as a side effect.
  Call zend_str_tolower() yourself if necessary. You no longer need to copy
  the haystack and needle before passing them to php_stristr().
* zend_register_module_ex() no longer copies the module entry.
* The main/php_stdint.h header has been removed.
  Include the standard <inttypes.h> and/or <stdint.h> headers instead.
  Replace usage of u_char by the standard C99 uint8_t type.
* A new ZEND_THREEWAY_COMPARE() macro has been introduced which does a
  three-way comparison of two integers and returns -1, 0 or 1 if the LHS is
  smaller, equal or larger than the RHS
* Deprecated zend_atoi() and zend_atol(). Use ZEND_STRTOL() for general purpose
  string to long conversion, or a variant of zend_ini_parse_quantity() for
  parsing ini quantities.
* The return types of the following object handlers has changed from int to zend_result
  - zend_object_cast_t
  - zend_object_count_elements_t
  - zend_object_get_closure_t
  - zend_object_do_operation_t
* Added a new zero_position argument to php_stream_fopen_from_fd_rel to reflect
  if this a newly created file so the current file offset needs not to be checked.

========================
2. Build system changes
========================

========================
3. Module changes
========================

  a. ext/standard
    - The PHP APIs string_natural_compare_function_ex(),
      string_natural_case_compare_function(), and string_natural_compare_function()
      have been removed. They always returned SUCCESS and were a wrapper around
      strnatcmp_ex(). Use strnatcmp_ex() directly instead.
  b. ext/pdo
    - pdo_raise_impl_error()'s parameter sqlstate has been changed from
      const char * to pdo_error_type (aka char [6]).

========================
4. OpCode changes
========================

* The ZEND_INIT_FCALL opcode now asserts that the function exists in the symbol
  table as the function's existence is checked at compile time.
  For extensions modifying the function symbol table, setting
  CG(compiler_options) |= ZEND_COMPILE_IGNORE_USER_FUNCTIONS | ZEND_COMPILE_IGNORE_INTERNAL_FUNCTIONS;
  will produce ZEND_INIT_FCALL_BY_NAME opcodes instead which check for the
  existence of the function at runtime.

========================
5. SAPI changes
========================

 * The signature of php_module_startup() has changed from
   int php_module_startup(sapi_module_struct *sf, zend_module_entry *additional_modules, uint32_t num_additional_modules)
   to
   zend_result php_module_startup(sapi_module_struct *sf, zend_module_entry *additional_module)
   as only one additional module was ever provided.

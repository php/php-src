PHP 8.4 INTERNALS UPGRADE NOTES

1. Internal API changes

2. Build system changes

3. Module changes

4. OpCode changes

5. SAPI changes

========================
1. Internal API changes
========================

* zend_register_module_ex() now takes an additional int module_type argument.
  This function will also assign the module number and type, there is no need
  to do this at the call site anymore. Writing the handle should happen after
  successful registration.

* ZPP now accepts a F or Z_PARAM_FUNC_NO_TRAMPOLINE_FREE type check.
  This is identical to the 'f' or Z_PARAM_FUNC type check, except the FCC is
  always initialized because it doesn't free trampolines.
  Trampolines MUST be freed using zend_release_fcall_info_cache() or consumed.
  Z_PARAM_FUNC_EX2 was added as well with the same arguments as Z_PARAM_FUNC_EX
  plus an additional argument free_trampoline.

========================
2. Build system changes
========================

 a. Unix build system changes
   - The configure option --with-zlib-dir has been removed.
   - Symbol COOKIE_IO_FUNCTIONS_T has been removed (use cookie_io_functions_t).

========================
3. Module changes
========================

 a. ext/dom
   - dom_read_t and dom_write_t now expect the function to return zend_result
     instead of int.
   - The macros DOM_NO_ARGS() and DOM_NOT_IMPLEMENTED() have been removed.

 b. ext/random
   - The macro RAND_RANGE_BADSCALING() has been removed. The implementation
     should either be inlined and undefined behavior fixed or it should be
     replaced by a non-biased scaler.

 c. ext/xsl
   - The function php_xsl_create_object() was removed as it was not used
     nor exported.

 d. ext/libxml
   - Added php_libxml_pretend_ctx_error_ex() to emit errors as if they had come
     from libxml.

 e. ext/date
   - Added the php_format_date_ex() API to format instances of php_date_obj.
   - Added the php_date_initialize_from_ts_long() and
     php_date_initialize_from_ts_double() to initialize a php_date_obj with
     the given unix timestamp using GMT +00:00.

 d. ext/pcre
   - php_pcre_match_impl() now no longer has a use_flags argument.
     When flags should be ignored, pass 0 to the flags argument.
   - php_pcre_match_impl() and pcre_get_compiled_regex_cache_ex() now use
     proper boolean argument types instead of integer types.

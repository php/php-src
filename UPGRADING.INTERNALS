3. Module changes

4. OpCode changes

5. SAPI changes

========================
1. Internal API changes
========================

* zend_register_module_ex() now takes an additional int module_type argument.
  This function will also assign the module number and type, there is no need
  to do this at the call site anymore. Writing the handle should happen after
  successful registration.

* ZPP now accepts a F or Z_PARAM_FUNC_NO_TRAMPOLINE_FREE type check.
  This is identical to the 'f' or Z_PARAM_FUNC type check, except the FCC is
  always initialized because it doesn't free trampolines.
  Trampolines MUST be freed using zend_release_fcall_info_cache() or consumed.
  Z_PARAM_FUNC_EX2 was added as well with the same arguments as Z_PARAM_FUNC_EX
  plus an additional argument free_trampoline.

* The zend_object_iterator_funcs valid member has changed its signature from
  int(*)(zend_object_iterator *) to zend_result(*)(zend_object_iterator *) to
  be more in line with what callbacks are returning.

* The backwards compatibility headers ext/standard/{php_lcg.h,php_mt_rand.h,
  php_rand.h,php_random.h} have been removed. Include ext/random/php_random.h
  directly.

* The zend_*printf family of functions now supports the "%S" modifier to print
  out zend_string*. This won't cut off the string if it embeds a NUL byte.

* The inet_aton() and win32/inet.h have been removed. Use platform-agnostic
  inet_pton() from arpa/inet.h or ws2tcpip.h on Windows.

* zend_mm_set_custom_debug_handlers() has been removed from ZendMM, use
  zend_mm_set_custom_handlers() instead which now supports DEBUG builds

* zend_mm_set_custom_handlers() has changed its signature from
  void()(zend_mm_heap *heap,
         void* (*_malloc)(size_t),
         void  (*_free)(void*),
         void* (*_realloc)(void*, size_t))
  to
  void()(zend_mm_heap *heap,
         void* (*_malloc)(size_t ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC ZEND_FILE_LINE_ORIG_DC),
         void  (*_free)(void* ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC ZEND_FILE_LINE_ORIG_DC),
         void* (*_realloc)(void*, size_t ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC ZEND_FILE_LINE_ORIG_DC))

* zend_mm_get_custom_handlers() has changed its signature from
  void()(zend_mm_heap *heap,
         void* (**_malloc)(size_t),
         void  (**_free)(void*),
         void* (**_realloc)(void*, size_t))
  to
  void()(zend_mm_heap *heap,
         void* (**_malloc)(size_t ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC ZEND_FILE_LINE_ORIG_DC),
         void  (**_free)(void* ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC ZEND_FILE_LINE_ORIG_DC),
         void* (**_realloc)(void*, size_t ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC ZEND_FILE_LINE_ORIG_DC))

* __zend_malloc() has changed their signature from
  void(*)(size_t) to
  void(*)(size_t ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC ZEND_FILE_LINE_ORIG_DC)

* __zend_calloc() has changed their signature from
  void(*)(size_t, size_t) to
  void(*)(size_t, size_t ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC ZEND_FILE_LINE_ORIG_DC)

* __zend_realloc() has changed their signature from
  void(*)(void *, size_t) to
  void(*)(void *, size_t ZEND_FILE_LINE_DC ZEND_FILE_LINE_ORIG_DC)

* zend_observer_remove_begin_handler() and zend_observer_remove_end_handler()
  got each a new parameter returning an observer which must be called, if the
  removal happened during observer execution.

* zend_get_internal_function_extension_handle[s]() must now be used over
  zend_get_op_array_extension_handle[s]() when registering run_time_cache slots
  for internal functions. If you need a cache slot for both internal and user
  functions, you may obtain a slot for each through the corresponding function.

* zend_is_true now returns bool rather than int. Note that on PHP 8 this has
  always returned 0 or 1, so conversion should be trivial.

========================
3. Module changes
========================

 a. ext/dom
   - dom_read_t and dom_write_t now expect the function to return zend_result
     instead of int.
   - The macros DOM_NO_ARGS() and DOM_NOT_IMPLEMENTED() have been removed.
   - New public APIs are available to handle callbacks from XPath, see
     xpath_callbacks.h.
   - Added public APIs to manipulate namespace data, see namespace_compat.h.
   - php_dom_create_object() now no longer accepts a NULL obj argument.
   - Removed the `ret` argument from the DOM_RET_OBJ macro, use the return
     value instead.
   - Removed DOM_XMLNS_NAMESPACE from xml_common.h. Use DOM_XMLNS_NS_URI
     from namespace_compat.h instead.
   - Added php_dom_get_ns_mapper(), php_dom_next_in_tree_order(),
     php_dom_follow_spec_doc_ref(), and php_dom_follow_spec_doc_ref().

 b. ext/random
   - The macro RAND_RANGE_BADSCALING() has been removed. The implementation
     should either be inlined and undefined behavior fixed or it should be
     replaced by a non-biased scaler.
   - The generate member of a php_random_algo is now expected to return
     the new php_random_result struct, replacing the last_generated_size
     member of the php_random_status struct and the generate_size member of
     the php_random_algo struct.
   - The php_random_status struct has been removed, since the previous change
     reduced it to a single void* member containing the actual state, resulting
     in needless indirection. Functions taking a php_random_algo struct pointer
     and a php_random_status struct pointer as separate parameters now take a
     single php_random_algo_with_state struct by value, making it easier to
     pass around the state with its associated algorithm and thus reducing
     the chance for mistakes.
   - The seed member of a php_random_algo has been removed. As a replacement
     engine-specific seeding functions are now exposed. This change allows
     users to better take engine-specific behavior into account. As an example
     Mt19937 ignored the upper half of the seed parameter of the generic
     seeding function.
   - The CSPRNG API (php_random_(bytes|int)_*) is now provided by the new
     and much smaller php_random_csprng.h header. The new header is included
     in php_random.h for compatibility with existing users.
   - A new php_random_generate_fallback_seed() function has been added as a
     replacement for the generically named GENERATE_SEED(). The internal
     implementation has been improved to generate better seeds, however any
     users should use the opportunity to verify that seeding is first
     attempted using the CSPRNG for better output size flexibility.

 c. ext/xsl
   - The function php_xsl_create_object() was removed as it was not used
     nor exported.

 d. ext/libxml
   - Added php_libxml_pretend_ctx_error_ex() to emit errors as if they had come
     from libxml.
   - Added php_libxml_error_handler_va() to pass libxml errors, and
     corresponding php_libxml_error_level enum.
   - Removed the "properties" HashTable field from php_libxml_node_object.
   - Added a way to attached private data to a php_libxml_ref_obj.
   - Added a way to fix a class type onto php_libxml_ref_obj.
   - Added php_libxml_uses_internal_errors().
   - Added a way to override document handlers (e.g. serialization) with
     php_libxml_document_handlers.

 e. ext/date
   - Added the php_format_date_ex() API to format instances of php_date_obj.
   - Added the php_date_initialize_from_ts_long() and
     php_date_initialize_from_ts_double() to initialize a php_date_obj with
     the given unix timestamp using GMT +00:00.

 f. ext/pcre
   - php_pcre_match_impl() now no longer has a use_flags argument.
     When flags should be ignored, pass 0 to the flags argument.
   - php_pcre_match_impl() and pcre_get_compiled_regex_cache_ex() now use
     proper boolean argument types instead of integer types.
   - pcre_get_compiled_regex_cache_ex() now provides an option to collect extra
     options (from modifiers used in the expression, for example), and calls
     pcre2_set_compile_extra_options() with those options.

 g. ext/standard
   - Added the php_base64_encode_ex() API with flag parameters, value can be
     PHP_BASE64_NO_PADDING to encode without the padding character '='.

========================
4. OpCode changes
========================

* New FRAMELESS_ICALL_[0,3] opcodes for faster internal function calls have been
  added. These opcodes don't create a stack frame, but pass arguments via opcode
  operands. They only work for functions that are known at compile-time, and
  that provide a frameless handler (search for usages of the
  ZEND_FRAMELESS_FUNCTION macro).

========================
5. SAPI changes
========================

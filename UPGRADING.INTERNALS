PHP 8.5 INTERNALS UPGRADE NOTES

1. Internal API changes

2. Build system changes

3. Module changes

4. OpCode changes

5. SAPI changes

========================
1. Internal API changes
========================

- Zend
  . Added zend_safe_assign_to_variable_noref() function to safely assign
    a value to a non-reference zval.
  . Added zval_ptr_safe_dtor() to safely destroy a zval when a destructor
    could interfere.

========================
2. Build system changes
========================

- Windows build system changes
  . SAPI() and ADD_SOURCES() now suport the optional `duplicate_sources`
    parameter.  If truthy, no rules to build the object files are generated.
    This allows to build additional variants of SAPIs (e.g. a DLL and EXE)
    without duplicate build rules.  It is up to the SAPI maintainers to ensure
    that appropriate build rules are created.

========================
3. Module changes
========================

- ext/gd
  . The gdImageScale*() and gdImageRotate*() helpers are now internal in the
    bundled libgd, like they have been in external libgd as of gd-2.1.1.

- ext/json
  . php_json_encode_serializable_object() now assumes `EG(active)`,
    if not a bailout is caused. Therefore a minor BC break exists if the
    `PHP_JSON_PARTIAL_OUTPUT_ON_ERROR` option is in use.
    However, this situation is highly unlikely.

- ext/libxml
  . The refcount APIs now return an `unsigned int` instead of an `int`.

- ext/pdo
  . Added `php_pdo_stmt_valid_db_obj_handle()` to check if the database object
    is still valid. This is useful when a GC cycle is collected and the
    database object can be destroyed prior to destroying the statement.

4. OpCode changes

5. SAPI changes

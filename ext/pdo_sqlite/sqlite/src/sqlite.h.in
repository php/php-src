** should normally return 0.  If the callback returns a non-zero
** value then the query is aborted, all subsequent SQL statements
** are skipped and the sqlite3_exec() function returns the SQLITE_ABORT.
**
** The 1st parameter is an arbitrary pointer that is passed
** to the callback function as its first parameter.
**
** The 2nd parameter to the callback function is the number of
** columns in the query result.  The 3rd parameter to the callback
** is an array of strings holding the values for each column.
** The 4th parameter to the callback is an array of strings holding
** the names of each column.
**
** The callback function may be NULL, even for queries.  A NULL
** callback is not an error.  It just means that no callback
** will be invoked.
**
** If an error occurs while parsing or evaluating the SQL (but
** not while executing the callback) then an appropriate error
** message is written into memory obtained from malloc() and
** *errmsg is made to point to that message.  The calling function
** is responsible for freeing the memory that holds the error
** message.   Use sqlite3_free() for this.  If errmsg==NULL,
** then no error message is ever written.
**
** The return value is is SQLITE_OK if there are no errors and
** some other return code if there is an error.  The particular
** return value depends on the type of error. 
**
** If the query could not be executed because a database file is
** locked or busy, then this function returns SQLITE_BUSY.  (This
** behavior can be modified somewhat using the sqlite3_busy_handler()
** and sqlite3_busy_timeout() functions below.)

/*
** This routine identifies a callback function that is invoked
** whenever an attempt is made to open a database table that is
** currently locked by another process or thread.  If the busy callback
** is NULL, then sqlite3_exec() returns SQLITE_BUSY immediately if
** it finds a locked table.  If the busy callback is not NULL, then
** sqlite3_exec() invokes the callback with two arguments.  The
** first argument to the handler is a copy of the void* pointer which
** is the third argument to this routine.  The second argument to
** the handler is the number of times that the busy handler has
** been invoked for this locking event.  If the
** busy callback returns 0, then sqlite3_exec() immediately returns
** SQLITE_BUSY.  If the callback returns non-zero, then sqlite3_exec()
** tries to open the table again and the cycle repeats.
**
** The presence of a busy handler does not guarantee that
** it will be invoked when there is lock contention.
** If SQLite determines that invoking the busy handler could result in
** a deadlock, it will return SQLITE_BUSY instead.
** Consider a scenario where one process is holding a read lock that
** it is trying to promote to a reserved lock and
** a second process is holding a reserved lock that it is trying
** to promote to an exclusive lock.  The first process cannot proceed
** because it is blocked by the second and the second process cannot
** proceed because it is blocked by the first.  If both processes
** invoke the busy handlers, neither will make any progress.  Therefore,
** SQLite returns SQLITE_BUSY for the first process, hoping that this
** will induce the first process to release its read lock and allow
** the second process to proceed.
**
** The default busy callback is NULL.
**
** Sqlite is re-entrant, so the busy handler may start a new query. 
** (It is not clear why anyone would every want to do this, but it
** is allowed, in theory.)  But the busy handler may not close the
** database.  Closing the database from a busy handler will delete 
** data structures out from under the executing query and will 
** probably result in a coredump.

/*
** This next routine is really just a wrapper around sqlite3_exec().
** Instead of invoking a user-supplied callback for each row of the
** result, this routine remembers each row of the result in memory
** obtained from malloc(), then returns all of the result after the
** query has finished. 
**
** As an example, suppose the query result where this table:
**
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
**
** If the 3rd argument were &azResult then after the function returns
** azResult will contain the following data:
**
**        azResult[0] = "Name";
**        azResult[1] = "Age";
**        azResult[2] = "Alice";
**        azResult[3] = "43";
**        azResult[4] = "Bob";
**        azResult[5] = "28";
**        azResult[6] = "Cindy";
**        azResult[7] = "21";
**
** Notice that there is an extra row of data containing the column
** headers.  But the *nrow return value is still 3.  *ncolumn is
** set to 2.  In general, the number of values inserted into azResult
** will be ((*nrow) + 1)*(*ncolumn).
**
** After the calling function has finished using the result, it should 
** pass the result data pointer to sqlite3_free_table() in order to 
** release the memory that was malloc-ed.  Because of the way the 
** malloc() happens, the calling function must not try to call 
** free() directly.  Only sqlite3_free_table() is able to release 
** the memory properly and safely.
**
** The return value of this routine is the same as from sqlite3_exec().

** options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
**
** The strings returned by these routines should be freed by calling
** sqlite3_free().
**
** All of the usual printf formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is a "%q" option.  %q works like %s in that it substitutes a null-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, so some string variable contains text as follows:
**
**      char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
**
** We can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
**      char *z = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO TABLES('%q')", zText);
**      sqlite3_exec(db, z, callback1, 0, 0);
**      sqlite3_free(z);
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
**      INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
**      INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');

** is delivered up to the client application, the string will be automatically
** freed by sqlite3_free() and the zErrMsg field will be zeroed.  Note

1) Implement the following list entries and thier destructors:
	le_domxmlnotationp

2) Use ZEND_FETCH_RESOURCE() macros instead of custom functions.
3) Implement those classes we really want, kill all of the rest.
4) Remove debug code (many calls to fprintf()).
5) Make 1st arg always be the object. This is currently half-and-half, or so.
6) Take a hard look at startup/shutdown code. This is really running slower than
	it ought to be.
7) Fix the many, many memory leaks.
8) Modify new_child to allow creation of attribute, cdata, dtd, etc nodes.
9) implement schema support (libxml2 has it)
10) implement scheme handlers (like in ext/xslt), should be possible with xmlRegisterInputCallbacks
11) implement real sax support
	- input (building of dom-tree with sax-events) is almost finished
	- started with generating of sax-events from file/string (chregu)
	- generating sax-events from dom-tree is a more tricky one (see mailinglist of libxml2)
12) error reporting for xslt methods
13) add possibility to use relative xpath queries
14) implement $dom->free() for freeing documents from memory
15) implement get_element_by_tagname_ns (and improve namespace support in general)

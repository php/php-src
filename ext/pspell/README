README file for pspell (spellchecker) module for PHP
----------------------------------------------------

The latest release of pspell is always available from

  http://aspell.net/

This module was developed and tested with aspell-.31.1 and pspell-.11.0.2,
although slightly earlier (and hopefully later) versions of those libraries
should work as well.

General notes
-------------

Please, note that somewhere around version .27.x (I believe) aspell stopped
working with the aspell module for php. This is due to the fact that the
author changed things around a bit, and suggested that people link to pspell
in the future rather than to aspell. That's exactly what this module is for.
It has the same basic functionality as aspell (and more features are being
added). I did not want to modify existing aspell module, because it would
break things for those who are using older aspell, or result in very ugly code.
Rather, I wrote a new module - pspell.


Building pspell on a Unix system
--------------------------------

In order to use pspell, you need to have *both* aspell and pspell libraries
installed, and they have to be compatible with each other. Get the latest
release of both at the URL given above.

I expect the libraries to be in /usr/local (that's the default when you
cofigure pspell and aspell with their 'configure' scripts woth no parameters).
If that location is different, please specify it in --with-pspell=PATH, where
PATH is the path you specified for pspell libraries.

Notes on personalized dictionaries
----------------------------------

It is now possible to have personalized dictionaries with pspell. This is
achieved by opening a dictionary with pspell_new_personal() rather than
pspell_new() and specifying the custom dictionary as the first parameter.
The parameter probably should begin with '/' because otherwise it will
be relative to $HOME, which is probably set to "/root". This is probably not
what you want because you need write access for nobody to be able to write
to a dictionary. Once the dictionary is open, you can use
pspell_add_to_personal() to add words to the wordlist and finally
pspell_save_wordlist() to save it.

Note that at this moment pspell_save_wordlist() will return TRUE, even if
there was an error. This will be changed once pspell library is fixed.

/*************************************************
*         Validate a UTF-8 string                *
*************************************************/

/* This function is called (optionally) at the start of compile or match, to
validate that a supposed UTF-8 string is actually valid. The early check means
that subsequent code can assume it is dealing with a valid string. The check
can be turned off for maximum performance, but the consequences of supplying
an invalid string are then undefined.

Originally, this function checked according to RFC 2279, allowing for values in
the range 0 to 0x7fffffff, up to 6 bytes long, but ensuring that they were in
the canonical format. Once somebody had pointed out RFC 3629 to me (it
obsoletes 2279), additional restrictions were applied. The values are now
limited to be between 0 and 0x0010ffff, no more than 4 bytes long, and the
subrange 0xd000 to 0xdfff is excluded.

Arguments:
  string       points to the string
  length       length of string, or -1 if the string is zero-terminated

Returns:       < 0    if the string is a valid UTF-8 string
               >= 0   otherwise; the value is the offset of the bad byte

	Mersenne Twister random number generator -- a C++ class MTRand
	Based on code by Makoto Matsumoto, Takuji Nishimura, and Shawn Cokus
	Richard J. Wagner  v1.0  15 May 2003  rjwagner@writeme.com

	The Mersenne Twister is an algorithm for generating random numbers.  It
	was designed with consideration of the flaws in various other generators.
	The period, 2^19937-1, and the order of equidistribution, 623 dimensions,
	are far greater.  The generator is also fast; it avoids multiplication and
	division, and it benefits from caches and pipelines.  For more information
	see the inventors' web page at http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html

/*
 * A bit of tricky math here.  We want to avoid using a modulus because
 * that simply tosses the high-order bits and might skew the distribution
 * of random values over the range.  Instead we map the range directly.
 *
 * We need to map the range from 0...M evenly to the range a...b
 * Let n = the random number and n' = the mapped random number
 *
 * Then we have: n' = a + n(b-a)/M
 *
 * We have a problem here in that only n==M will get mapped to b which
 # means the chances of getting b is much much less than getting any of
 # the other values in the range.  We can fix this by increasing our range
 # artificially and using:
 #
 #               n' = a + n(b-a+1)/M
 *
 # Now we only have a problem if n==M which would cause us to produce a
 # number of b+1 which would be bad.  So we bump M up by one to make sure
 # this will never happen, and the final algorithm looks like this:
 #
 #               n' = a + n(b-a+1)/(M+1)

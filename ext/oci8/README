The OCI8 Extension
------------------

Use the OCI8 extension to access Oracle Database.

Documentation is at http://php.net/oci8

Use 'pecl install oci8' to install for PHP 7.

Use 'pecl install oci8-2.0.12' to install for PHP 5.2 - PHP 5.6.

Use 'pecl install oci8-1.4.10' to install for PHP 4.3.9 - PHP 5.1.

The OCI8 extension needs to be linked with Oracle 18, 12, 11, or 10.2
client libraries.  These libraries are found in your database
installation, or in the free Oracle Instant Client from
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/instant-client/overview/index.html
Install the 'Basic' or 'Basic Light' Instant Client package.  If
building from source, then also install the SDK package.

Oracle's standard cross-version interoperability applies.  For
example, PHP OCI8 linked with Instant Client 11.2 can connect to
Oracle Database 9.2 onward.  See Oracle's note "Oracle Client / Server
Interoperability Support" (ID 207303.1) for details.

    # This class represents a
    # {YAML sequence}[http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#sequence/syntax].
    #
    # A YAML sequence is basically a list, and looks like this:
    #
    #   %YAML 1.1
    #   ---
    #   - I am
    #   - a Sequence
    #
    # A YAML sequence may have an anchor like this:
    #
    #   %YAML 1.1
    #   ---
    #   &A [
    #     "This sequence",
    #     "has an anchor"
    #   ]
    #
    # A YAML sequence may also have a tag like this:
    #
    #   %YAML 1.1
    #   ---
    #   !!seq [
    #     "This sequence",
    #     "has a tag"
    #   ]
    #

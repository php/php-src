/******************************************************************************
** This file is an amalgamation of many separate C source files from SQLite
** version 3.5.9.  By combining all the individual C code files into this 
** single large file, the entire code can be compiled as a one translation
** unit.  This allows many compilers to do optimizations that would not be
** possible if the files were compiled separately.  Performance improvements
** of 5% are more are commonly seen when SQLite is compiled as a single
** translation unit.
**
** This file is all you need to compile SQLite.  To use SQLite in other
** programs, you need this file and the "sqlite3.h" header file that defines
** the programming interface to the SQLite library.  (If you do not have 
** the "sqlite3.h" header file at hand, you will find a copy in the first
** 5638 lines past this header comment.)  Additional code files may be
** needed if you want a wrapper to interface SQLite with your choice of
** programming language.  The code for the "sqlite3" command-line shell
** is also in a separate file.  This file contains only code for the core
** SQLite library.

** This amalgamation was generated on 2008-05-14 16:20:58 UTC.

**
** {F12125} If the 3rd parameter to [sqlite3_exec()] is NULL then
**          [sqlite3_exec()] never invokes a callback.  All query
**          results are silently discarded.
**
** {F12128} If an error occurs while parsing or evaluating any of the SQL

**          allocated using the equivalent of [sqlite3_mprintf()] and
**          *errmsg is made to point to that message.
**
** {F12134} The [sqlite3_exec()] routine does not change the value of
**          *errmsg if errmsg is NULL or if there are no errors.
**
** {F12137} The [sqlite3_exec()] function sets the error code and message
**          accessible via [sqlite3_errcode()], [sqlite3_errmsg()], and

**
** {U12142} The database connection must not be closed while
**          [sqlite3_exec()] is running.
** 
** {U12143} The calling function is should use [sqlite3_free()] to free
**          the memory that *errmsg is left pointing at once the error
**          message is no longer needed.
**
** {U12145} The SQL statement text in the 2nd parameter to [sqlite3_exec()]

**
** In its default configuration, SQLite API routines return one of 26 integer
** [SQLITE_OK | result codes].  However, experience has shown that
** many of these result codes are too course-grained.  They do not provide as
** much information about problems as programmers might like.  In an effort to
** address this, newer versions of SQLite (version 3.3.8 and later) include
** support for additional result codes that provide more detailed information
** about errors. The extended result codes are enabled or disabled
** for each database connection using the [sqlite3_extended_result_codes()]
** API.
** 
** Some of the available extended result codes are listed here.
** One may expect the number of extended result codes will be expand
** over time.  Software that uses extended result codes should expect
** to see new result codes in future releases of SQLite.
**
** The SQLITE_OK result code will never be extended.  It will always
** be exactly zero.
** 
** INVARIANTS:
**
** {F10223} The symbolic name for an extended result code always contains
**          a related primary result code as a prefix.
**
** {F10224} Primary result code names contain a single "_" character.
**
** {F10225} Extended result code names contain two or more "_" characters.
**

** Every file opened by the [sqlite3_vfs] xOpen method contains a pointer to
** an instance of this object.  This object defines the

**
** The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or

** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or

** if such a lock exists and false if not.
** 
** The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom

** is an integer opcode.   The third
** argument is a generic pointer which is intended to be a pointer
** to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
** write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
** functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
** locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
** about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
** core reserves opcodes less than 100 for its own use.

**
** An instance of this object defines the interface between the

** in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".
**
** The iVersion field is initially 1 but may be larger for future
** versions of SQLite.  Additional fields may be appended to this
** object when the iVersion value is increased.
**
** The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
** structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
** a pathname in this VFS.
**
** Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
** the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
** and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
** in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
** searches the list.
**
** The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs 
** structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
** or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
** The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
** object once the object has been registered.
**
** The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
** be unique across all VFS modules.
**
** {F11141} SQLite will guarantee that the zFilename string passed to
** xOpen() is a full pathname as generated by xFullPathname() and
** that the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
** called.  {END} So the [sqlite3_file] can store a pointer to the
** filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
**
** {F11142} The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
** the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
** or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
** [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]. {END}
** If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
** include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be
** set.
** 
** {F11143} SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
** call, depending on the object being opened:
** 
** <ul>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MASTER_JOURNAL]
** </ul> {END}
**
** The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
** changes the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
** that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
** the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
** also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return 
** SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database 
** file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random 
** order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
** 
** SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen
** method:
** 
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
** </ul>
** 
** {F11145} The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
** deleted when it is closed.  {F11146} The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** will be set for TEMP  databases, journals and for subjournals. 
** {F11147} The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag means the file should be opened
** for exclusive access.  This flag is set for all files except
** for the main database file. {END}
** 
** {F11148} At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite 
** to hold the  [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third 
** argument to xOpen.  {END}  The xOpen method does not have to
** allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.
** 
** {F11149} The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS] 
** to test for the existance of a file,
** or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to test to see
** if a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
** to test to see if a file is at least readable.  {END} The file can be a 
** directory.
** 
** {F11150} SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for
** the output buffers for xGetTempname and xFullPathname. {F11151} The exact
** size of the output buffer is also passed as a parameter to both 
** methods. {END} If the output buffer is not large enough, SQLITE_CANTOPEN
** should be returned. As this is handled as a fatal error by SQLite,
** vfs implementations should endeavor to prevent this by setting 
** mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
** 
** The xRandomness(), xSleep(), and xCurrentTime() interfaces
** are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
** included in the VFS structure for completeness.
** The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
** of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
** the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.  The
** xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
** least the number of microseconds given.  The xCurrentTime()

**
** An INSERT that fails due to a constraint violation is not a

**
** This routine identifies a callback function that might be

** that another thread or process has locked.
** If the busy callback is NULL, then [SQLITE_BUSY]
** or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED]
** is returned immediately upon encountering the lock.
** If the busy callback is not NULL, then the
** callback will be invoked with two arguments.  The
** first argument to the handler is a copy of the void* pointer which
** is the third argument to this routine.  The second argument to
** the handler is the number of times that the busy handler has
** been invoked for this locking event.   If the
** busy callback returns 0, then no additional attempts are made to
** access the database and [SQLITE_BUSY] or [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED] is returned.
** If the callback returns non-zero, then another attempt
** is made to open the database for reading and the cycle repeats.
**
** The presence of a busy handler does not guarantee that
** it will be invoked when there is lock contention.
** If SQLite determines that invoking the busy handler could result in
** a deadlock, it will go ahead and return [SQLITE_BUSY] or
** [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED] instead of invoking the
** busy handler.
** Consider a scenario where one process is holding a read lock that
** it is trying to promote to a reserved lock and
** a second process is holding a reserved lock that it is trying
** to promote to an exclusive lock.  The first process cannot proceed
** because it is blocked by the second and the second process cannot

** SQLite returns [SQLITE_BUSY] for the first process, hoping that this
** will induce the first process to release its read lock and allow
** the second process to proceed.
**
** The default busy callback is NULL.
**
** The [SQLITE_BUSY] error is converted to [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED]
** when SQLite is in the middle of a large transaction where all the
** changes will not fit into the in-memory cache.  SQLite will
** already hold a RESERVED lock on the database file, but it needs
** to promote this lock to EXCLUSIVE so that it can spill cache
** pages into the database file without harm to concurrent
** readers.  If it is unable to promote the lock, then the in-memory
** cache will be left in an inconsistent state and so the error
** code is promoted from the relatively benign [SQLITE_BUSY] to
** the more severe [SQLITE_IOERR_BLOCKED].  This error code promotion
** forces an automatic rollback of the changes.  See the

** CAPI3REF: Convenience Routines For Running Queries {F12370}
**
** Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the
** [sqlite3_get_table()] interface.  A result table records the
** complete query results from one or more queries.
**
** The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.  But
** these numbers are not part of the result table itself.  These
** numbers are obtained separately.  Let N be the number of rows
** and M be the number of columns.
**
** A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated
** UTF-8 strings.  There are (N+1)*M elements in the array.  
** The first M pointers point to zero-terminated strings that 
** contain the names of the columns.
** The remaining entries all point to query results.  NULL
** values are give a NULL pointer.  All other values are in
** their UTF-8 zero-terminated string representation as returned by
** [sqlite3_column_text()].
**
** A result table might consists of one or more memory allocations.
** It is not safe to pass a result table directly to [sqlite3_free()].
** A result table should be deallocated using [sqlite3_free_table()].
**
** As an example of the result table format, suppose a query result
** is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** There are two column (M==2) and three rows (N==3).  Thus the
** result table has 8 entries.  Suppose the result table is stored
** in an array names azResult.  Then azResult holds this content:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        azResult&#91;0] = "Name";
**        azResult&#91;1] = "Age";
**        azResult&#91;2] = "Alice";
**        azResult&#91;3] = "43";
**        azResult&#91;4] = "Bob";
**        azResult&#91;5] = "28";
**        azResult&#91;6] = "Cindy";
**        azResult&#91;7] = "21";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The sqlite3_get_table() function evaluates one or more
** semicolon-separated SQL statements in the zero-terminated UTF-8
** string of its 2nd parameter.  It returns a result table to the
** pointer given in its 3rd parameter.
**
** After the calling function has finished using the result, it should 
** pass the pointer to the result table to sqlite3_free_table() in order to 
** release the memory that was malloc-ed.  Because of the way the 
** [sqlite3_malloc()] happens within sqlite3_get_table(), the calling
** function must not try to call [sqlite3_free()] directly.  Only 
** [sqlite3_free_table()] is able to release the memory properly and safely.
**

** [sqlite3_exec()].  The sqlite3_get_table() routine does not have access
** to any internal data structures of SQLite.  It uses only the public
** interface defined here.  As a consequence, errors that occur in the
** wrapper layer outside of the internal [sqlite3_exec()] call are not
** reflected in subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] or
** [sqlite3_errmsg()].

**
** {F12371} If a [sqlite3_get_table()] fails a memory allocation, then

** CAPI3REF: Formatted String Printing Functions {F17400}
**
** These routines are workalikes of the "printf()" family of functions
** from the standard C library.
**
** The sqlite3_mprintf() and sqlite3_vmprintf() routines write their
** results into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].
** The strings returned by these two routines should be
** released by [sqlite3_free()].   Both routines return a
** NULL pointer if [sqlite3_malloc()] is unable to allocate enough
** memory to hold the resulting string.
**
** In sqlite3_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
** the standard C library.  The result is written into the
** buffer supplied as the second parameter whose size is given by
** the first parameter. Note that the order of the
** first two parameters is reversed from snprintf().  This is an
** historical accident that cannot be fixed without breaking
** backwards compatibility.  Note also that sqlite3_snprintf()
** returns a pointer to its buffer instead of the number of
** characters actually written into the buffer.  We admit that
** the number of characters written would be a more useful return
** value but we cannot change the implementation of sqlite3_snprintf()
** now without breaking compatibility.
**
** As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite3_snprintf()
** guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated.  The first
** parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
** the zero terminator.  So the longest string that can be completely
** written will be n-1 characters.
**
** These routines all implement some additional formatting
** options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
** All of the usual printf formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is are "%q", "%Q", and "%z" options.
**
** The %q option works like %s in that it substitutes a null-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, so some string variable contains text as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you
** should always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string 
** literal.
**
** The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around
** the outside of the total string.  Or if the parameter in the argument
** list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without single
** quotes) in place of the %Q option. {END}  So, for example, one could say:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(%Q)", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The code above will render a correct SQL statement in the zSQL
** variable even if the zText variable is a NULL pointer.
**
** The "%z" formatting option works exactly like "%s" with the
** addition that after the string has been read and copied into
** the result, [sqlite3_free()] is called on the input string. {END}

/*
** CAPI3REF: Memory Allocation Subsystem {F17300}
**
** The SQLite core  uses these three routines for all of its own
** internal memory allocation needs. "Core" in the previous sentence
** does not include operating-system specific VFS implementation.  The
** windows VFS uses native malloc and free for some operations.
**
** The sqlite3_malloc() routine returns a pointer to a block
** of memory at least N bytes in length, where N is the parameter.
** If sqlite3_malloc() is unable to obtain sufficient free
** memory, it returns a NULL pointer.  If the parameter N to
** sqlite3_malloc() is zero or negative then sqlite3_malloc() returns
** a NULL pointer.
**
** Calling sqlite3_free() with a pointer previously returned
** by sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc() releases that memory so
** that it might be reused.  The sqlite3_free() routine is
** a no-op if is called with a NULL pointer.  Passing a NULL pointer
** to sqlite3_free() is harmless.  After being freed, memory
** should neither be read nor written.  Even reading previously freed
** memory might result in a segmentation fault or other severe error.
** Memory corruption, a segmentation fault, or other severe error
** might result if sqlite3_free() is called with a non-NULL pointer that
** was not obtained from sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_free().
**
** The sqlite3_realloc() interface attempts to resize a
** prior memory allocation to be at least N bytes, where N is the
** second parameter.  The memory allocation to be resized is the first
** parameter.  If the first parameter to sqlite3_realloc()
** is a NULL pointer then its behavior is identical to calling
** sqlite3_malloc(N) where N is the second parameter to sqlite3_realloc().
** If the second parameter to sqlite3_realloc() is zero or
** negative then the behavior is exactly the same as calling
** sqlite3_free(P) where P is the first parameter to sqlite3_realloc().
** Sqlite3_realloc() returns a pointer to a memory allocation
** of at least N bytes in size or NULL if sufficient memory is unavailable.
** If M is the size of the prior allocation, then min(N,M) bytes
** of the prior allocation are copied into the beginning of buffer returned
** by sqlite3_realloc() and the prior allocation is freed.
** If sqlite3_realloc() returns NULL, then the prior allocation
** is not freed.
**
** The memory returned by sqlite3_malloc() and sqlite3_realloc()
** is always aligned to at least an 8 byte boundary. {END}
**
** The default implementation
** of the memory allocation subsystem uses the malloc(), realloc()
** and free() provided by the standard C library. {F17382} However, if 
** SQLite is compiled with the following C preprocessor macro
**
** <blockquote> SQLITE_MEMORY_SIZE=<i>NNN</i> </blockquote>
**
** where <i>NNN</i> is an integer, then SQLite create a static
** array of at least <i>NNN</i> bytes in size and use that array
** for all of its dynamic memory allocation needs. {END}  Additional
** memory allocator options may be added in future releases.
**
** In SQLite version 3.5.0 and 3.5.1, it was possible to define
** the SQLITE_OMIT_MEMORY_ALLOCATION which would cause the built-in
** implementation of these routines to be omitted.  That capability
** is no longer provided.  Only built-in memory allocators can be
** used.
**
** The windows OS interface layer calls
** the system malloc() and free() directly when converting
** filenames between the UTF-8 encoding used by SQLite
** and whatever filename encoding is used by the particular windows
** installation.  Memory allocation errors are detected, but
** they are reported back as [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] or
** [SQLITE_IOERR] rather than [SQLITE_NOMEM].
**
** INVARIANTS:
**
** {F17303}  The [sqlite3_malloc(N)] interface returns either a pointer to 
**           newly checked-out block of at least N bytes of memory
**           that is 8-byte aligned, 
**           or it returns NULL if it is unable to fulfill the request.
**
** {F17304}  The [sqlite3_malloc(N)] interface returns a NULL pointer if
**           N is less than or equal to zero.
**
** {F17305}  The [sqlite3_free(P)] interface releases memory previously
**           returned from [sqlite3_malloc()] or [sqlite3_realloc()],
**           making it available for reuse.
**
** {F17306}  A call to [sqlite3_free(NULL)] is a harmless no-op.
**
** {F17310}  A call to [sqlite3_realloc(0,N)] is equivalent to a call
**           to [sqlite3_malloc(N)].
**
** {F17312}  A call to [sqlite3_realloc(P,0)] is equivalent to a call
**           to [sqlite3_free(P)].
**
** {F17315}  The SQLite core uses [sqlite3_malloc()], [sqlite3_realloc()],
**           and [sqlite3_free()] for all of its memory allocation and
**           deallocation needs.
**
** {F17318}  The [sqlite3_realloc(P,N)] interface returns either a pointer
**           to a block of checked-out memory of at least N bytes in size
**           that is 8-byte aligned, or a NULL pointer.
**
** {F17321}  When [sqlite3_realloc(P,N)] returns a non-NULL pointer, it first
**           copies the first K bytes of content from P into the newly allocated
**           where K is the lessor of N and the size of the buffer P.
**
** {F17322}  When [sqlite3_realloc(P,N)] returns a non-NULL pointer, it first
**           releases the buffer P.
**
** {F17323}  When [sqlite3_realloc(P,N)] returns NULL, the buffer P is
**           not modified or released.
**
** LIMITATIONS:
**
** {U17350}  The pointer arguments to [sqlite3_free()] and [sqlite3_realloc()]

** CAPI3REF: Compile-Time Authorization Callbacks {F12500}
**
** This routine registers a authorizer callback with a particular
** [database connection], supplied in the first argument.
** The authorizer callback is invoked as SQL statements are being compiled
** by [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants [sqlite3_prepare_v2()],
** [sqlite3_prepare16()] and [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()].  At various
** points during the compilation process, as logic is being created
** to perform various actions, the authorizer callback is invoked to
** see if those actions are allowed.  The authorizer callback should
** return [SQLITE_OK] to allow the action, [SQLITE_IGNORE] to disallow the
** specific action but allow the SQL statement to continue to be
** compiled, or [SQLITE_DENY] to cause the entire SQL statement to be
** rejected with an error.   If the authorizer callback returns
** any value other than [SQLITE_IGNORE], [SQLITE_OK], or [SQLITE_DENY]
** then [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered
** the authorizer will fail with an error message.
**
** When the callback returns [SQLITE_OK], that means the operation
** requested is ok.  When the callback returns [SQLITE_DENY], the
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered the
** authorizer will fail with an error message explaining that
** access is denied.  If the authorizer code is [SQLITE_READ]
** and the callback returns [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the
** [prepared statement] statement is constructed to substitute
** a NULL value in place of the table column that would have
** been read if [SQLITE_OK] had been returned.  The [SQLITE_IGNORE]
** return can be used to deny an untrusted user access to individual
** columns of a table.
**
** The first parameter to the authorizer callback is a copy of
** the third parameter to the sqlite3_set_authorizer() interface.
** The second parameter to the callback is an integer 
** [SQLITE_COPY | action code] that specifies the particular action
** to be authorized. The third through sixth
** parameters to the callback are zero-terminated strings that contain 
** additional details about the action to be authorized.
**
** An authorizer is used when [sqlite3_prepare | preparing]
** SQL statements from an untrusted
** source, to ensure that the SQL statements do not try to access data
** that they are not allowed to see, or that they do not try to
** execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For
** example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary
** SQL queries for evaluation by a database.  But the application does
** not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
** database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
** user-entered SQL is being [sqlite3_prepare | prepared] that
** disallows everything except [SELECT] statements.
**
** Applications that need to process SQL from untrusted sources
** might also consider lowering resource limits using [sqlite3_limit()]
** and limiting database size using the [max_page_count] [PRAGMA]
** in addition to using an authorizer.
**
** Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
** at a time.  Each call to sqlite3_set_authorizer overrides the
** previous call.  Disable the authorizer by installing a NULL callback.
** The authorizer is disabled by default.
**
** Note that the authorizer callback is invoked only during 
** [sqlite3_prepare()] or its variants.  Authorization is not
** performed during statement evaluation in [sqlite3_step()].

/*
** CAPI3REF: Opening A New Database Connection {F12700}
**
** These routines open an SQLite database file whose name
** is given by the filename argument.
** The filename argument is interpreted as UTF-8
** for [sqlite3_open()] and [sqlite3_open_v2()] and as UTF-16
** in the native byte order for [sqlite3_open16()].
** An [sqlite3*] handle is usually returned in *ppDb, even
** if an error occurs.  The only exception is if SQLite is unable
** to allocate memory to hold the [sqlite3] object, a NULL will
** be written into *ppDb instead of a pointer to the [sqlite3] object.
** If the database is opened (and/or created)
** successfully, then [SQLITE_OK] is returned.  Otherwise an
** error code is returned.  The
** [sqlite3_errmsg()] or [sqlite3_errmsg16()]  routines can be used to obtain
** an English language description of the error.
**
** The default encoding for the database will be UTF-8 if
** [sqlite3_open()] or [sqlite3_open_v2()] is called and
** UTF-16 in the native byte order if [sqlite3_open16()] is used.
**
** Whether or not an error occurs when it is opened, resources
** associated with the [sqlite3*] handle should be released by passing it
** to [sqlite3_close()] when it is no longer required.
**
** The [sqlite3_open_v2()] interface works like [sqlite3_open()] 
** except that it acccepts two additional parameters for additional control
** over the new database connection.  The flags parameter can be
** one of:
**
** <ol>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]
** </ol>
**
** The first value opens the database read-only. 
** If the database does not previously exist, an error is returned.
** The second option opens
** the database for reading and writing if possible, or reading only if
** if the file is write protected.  In either case the database
** must already exist or an error is returned.  The third option
** opens the database for reading and writing and creates it if it does
** not already exist.
** The third options is behavior that is always used for [sqlite3_open()]
** and [sqlite3_open16()].
**
** If the 3rd parameter to [sqlite3_open_v2()] is not one of the
** combinations shown above then the behavior is undefined.
**
** If the filename is ":memory:", then an private
** in-memory database is created for the connection.  This in-memory
** database will vanish when the database connection is closed.  Future
** version of SQLite might make use of additional special filenames
** that begin with the ":" character.  It is recommended that 
** when a database filename really does begin with
** ":" that you prefix the filename with a pathname like "./" to
** avoid ambiguity.
**
** If the filename is an empty string, then a private temporary
** on-disk database will be created.  This private database will be
** automatically deleted as soon as the database connection is closed.
**
** The fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is the name of the
** [sqlite3_vfs] object that defines the operating system 
** interface that the new database connection should use.  If the
** fourth parameter is a NULL pointer then the default [sqlite3_vfs]
** object is used.
**
** <b>Note to windows users:</b>  The encoding used for the filename argument
** of [sqlite3_open()] and [sqlite3_open_v2()] must be UTF-8, not whatever
** codepage is currently defined.  Filenames containing international
** characters must be converted to UTF-8 prior to passing them into
** [sqlite3_open()] or [sqlite3_open_v2()].
**
** INVARIANTS:
**
** {F12701} The [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open16()], and
**          [sqlite3_open_v2()] interfaces create a new
**          [database connection] associated with
**          the database file given in their first parameter.
**
** {F12702} The filename argument is interpreted as UTF-8
**          for [sqlite3_open()] and [sqlite3_open_v2()] and as UTF-16
**          in the native byte order for [sqlite3_open16()].
**
** {F12703} A successful invocation of [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open16()],

**
** {F12704} The [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open16()], and
**          [sqlite3_open_v2()] interfaces return [SQLITE_OK] upon success,

**
** {F12711} If the G parameter to [sqlite3_open_v2(F,D,G,V)] contains the

**
** {F12712} If the G parameter to [sqlite3_open_v2(F,D,G,V)] contains the

**          file is write protected by the operating system.
**
** {F12713} If the G parameter to [sqlite3_open(v2(F,D,G,V)] omits the

**
** {F12717} If the filename argument to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open16()],
**          or [sqlite3_open_v2()] is ":memory:", then an private,

** CAPI3REF: Compiling An SQL Statement {F13010}
**
** To execute an SQL query, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
** program using one of these routines. 
**
** The first argument "db" is an [database connection] 
** obtained from a prior call to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()]
** or [sqlite3_open16()]. 
** The second argument "zSql" is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare_v2()
** interfaces uses UTF-8 and sqlite3_prepare16() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2()
** use UTF-16. {END}
**
** If the nByte argument is less
** than zero, then zSql is read up to the first zero terminator.
** If nByte is non-negative, then it is the maximum number of 
** bytes read from zSql.  When nByte is non-negative, the
** zSql string ends at either the first '\000' or '\u0000' character or 
** the nByte-th byte, whichever comes first. If the caller knows
** that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then there is a small
** performance advantage to be had by passing an nByte parameter that 
** is equal to the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i> 
** the nul-terminator bytes.{END}
**
** *pzTail is made to point to the first byte past the end of the
** first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only compiles the first
** statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to what remains
** uncompiled.
**
** *ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled [prepared statement] that can be
** executed using [sqlite3_step()].  Or if there is an error, *ppStmt is
** set to NULL.  If the input text contains no SQL (if the input
** is and empty string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.
** {U13018} The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the
** compiled SQL statement
** using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
**
** On success, [SQLITE_OK] is returned.  Otherwise an 
** [error code] is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_prepare_v2() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() interfaces are
** recommended for all new programs. The two older interfaces are retained
** for backwards compatibility, but their use is discouraged.
** In the "v2" interfaces, the prepared statement
** that is returned (the [sqlite3_stmt] object) contains a copy of the 
** original SQL text. {END} This causes the [sqlite3_step()] interface to
** behave a differently in two ways:
**
** <ol>
** <li>
** If the database schema changes, instead of returning [SQLITE_SCHEMA] as it
** always used to do, [sqlite3_step()] will automatically recompile the SQL
** statement and try to run it again.  If the schema has changed in
** a way that makes the statement no longer valid, [sqlite3_step()] will still
** return [SQLITE_SCHEMA].  But unlike the legacy behavior, 
** [SQLITE_SCHEMA] is now a fatal error.  Calling
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] again will not make the
** error go away.  Note: use [sqlite3_errmsg()] to find the text
** of the parsing error that results in an [SQLITE_SCHEMA] return. {END}
** </li>
**
** <li>
** When an error occurs, 
** [sqlite3_step()] will return one of the detailed 
** [error codes] or [extended error codes]. 
** The legacy behavior was that [sqlite3_step()] would only return a generic
** [SQLITE_ERROR] result code and you would have to make a second call to
** [sqlite3_reset()] in order to find the underlying cause of the problem.
** With the "v2" prepare interfaces, the underlying reason for the error is
** returned immediately.

** KEYWORDS: {protected sqlite3_value} {unprotected sqlite3_value}
**
** SQLite uses the sqlite3_value object to represent all values
** that can be stored in a database table.
** SQLite uses dynamic typing for the values it stores.  
** Values stored in sqlite3_value objects can be
** be integers, floating point values, strings, BLOBs, or NULL.
**
** An sqlite3_value object may be either "protected" or "unprotected".
** Some interfaces require a protected sqlite3_value.  Other interfaces
** will accept either a protected or an unprotected sqlite3_value.
** Every interface that accepts sqlite3_value arguments specifies 
** whether or not it requires a protected sqlite3_value.
**
** The terms "protected" and "unprotected" refer to whether or not
** a mutex is held.  A internal mutex is held for a protected
** sqlite3_value object but no mutex is held for an unprotected
** sqlite3_value object.  If SQLite is compiled to be single-threaded
** (with SQLITE_THREADSAFE=0 and with [sqlite3_threadsafe()] returning 0)
** then there is no distinction between
** protected and unprotected sqlite3_value objects and they can be
** used interchangable.  However, for maximum code portability it
** is recommended that applications make the distinction between
** between protected and unprotected sqlite3_value objects even if
** they are single threaded.
**
** The sqlite3_value objects that are passed as parameters into the
** implementation of application-defined SQL functions are protected.
** The sqlite3_value object returned by
** [sqlite3_column_value()] is unprotected.
** Unprotected sqlite3_value objects may only be used with
** [sqlite3_result_value()] and [sqlite3_bind_value()].  All other
** interfaces that use sqlite3_value require protected sqlite3_value objects.

/*
** CAPI3REF:  Binding Values To Prepared Statements {F13500}
**
** In the SQL strings input to [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and its
** variants, literals may be replace by a parameter in one
** of these forms:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  ?
** <li>  ?NNN
** <li>  :VVV
** <li>  @VVV
** <li>  $VVV
** </ul>
**
** In the parameter forms shown above NNN is an integer literal,
** VVV alpha-numeric parameter name.
** The values of these parameters (also called "host parameter names"
** or "SQL parameters")
** can be set using the sqlite3_bind_*() routines defined here.
**
** The first argument to the sqlite3_bind_*() routines always
** is a pointer to the [sqlite3_stmt] object returned from
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or its variants. The second
** argument is the index of the parameter to be set. The
** first parameter has an index of 1.  When the same named
** parameter is used more than once, second and subsequent
** occurrences have the same index as the first occurrence. 
** The index for named parameters can be looked up using the
** [sqlite3_bind_parameter_name()] API if desired.  The index
** for "?NNN" parameters is the value of NNN.
** The NNN value must be between 1 and the compile-time
** parameter SQLITE_MAX_VARIABLE_NUMBER (default value: 999).
**
** The third argument is the value to bind to the parameter.
**
** In those
** routines that have a fourth argument, its value is the number of bytes
** in the parameter.  To be clear: the value is the number of <u>bytes</u>
** in the value, not the number of characters. 
** If the fourth parameter is negative, the length of the string is
** number of bytes up to the first zero terminator.
**
** The fifth argument to sqlite3_bind_blob(), sqlite3_bind_text(), and
** sqlite3_bind_text16() is a destructor used to dispose of the BLOB or
** string after SQLite has finished with it. If the fifth argument is
** the special value [SQLITE_STATIC], then SQLite assumes that the
** information is in static, unmanaged space and does not need to be freed.
** If the fifth argument has the value [SQLITE_TRANSIENT], then
** SQLite makes its own private copy of the data immediately, before
** the sqlite3_bind_*() routine returns.
**
** The sqlite3_bind_zeroblob() routine binds a BLOB of length N that
** is filled with zeros.  A zeroblob uses a fixed amount of memory
** (just an integer to hold it size) while it is being processed.
** Zeroblobs are intended to serve as place-holders for BLOBs whose
** content is later written using 
** [sqlite3_blob_open | increment BLOB I/O] routines. A negative
** value for the zeroblob results in a zero-length BLOB.
**
** The sqlite3_bind_*() routines must be called after
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] (and its variants) or [sqlite3_reset()] and
** before [sqlite3_step()].
** Bindings are not cleared by the [sqlite3_reset()] routine.
** Unbound parameters are interpreted as NULL.
**
** These routines return [SQLITE_OK] on success or an error code if
** anything goes wrong.  [SQLITE_RANGE] is returned if the parameter
** index is out of range.  [SQLITE_NOMEM] is returned if malloc fails.
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] might be returned if these routines are called on a
** virtual machine that is the wrong state or which has already been finalized.
** Detection of misuse is unreliable.  Applications should not depend
** on SQLITE_MISUSE returns.  SQLITE_MISUSE is intended to indicate a
** a logic error in the application.  Future versions of SQLite might
** panic rather than return SQLITE_MISUSE.

**
** After an [prepared statement] has been prepared with a call
** to either [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or to one of
** the legacy interfaces [sqlite3_prepare()] or [sqlite3_prepare16()],
** then this function must be called one or more times to evaluate the 
** statement.
**
** The details of the behavior of this sqlite3_step() interface depend
** on whether the statement was prepared using the newer "v2" interface
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or the older legacy
** interface [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()].  The use of the
** new "v2" interface is recommended for new applications but the legacy
** interface will continue to be supported.
**
** In the legacy interface, the return value will be either [SQLITE_BUSY], 
** [SQLITE_DONE], [SQLITE_ROW], [SQLITE_ERROR], or [SQLITE_MISUSE].
** With the "v2" interface, any of the other [SQLITE_OK | result code]
** or [SQLITE_IOERR_READ | extended result code] might be returned as
** well.
**
** [SQLITE_BUSY] means that the database engine was unable to acquire the
** database locks it needs to do its job.  If the statement is a COMMIT
** or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
** statement.  If the statement is not a COMMIT and occurs within a
** explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
** continuing.
**
** [SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
** successfully.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on this virtual
** machine without first calling [sqlite3_reset()] to reset the virtual
** machine back to its initial state.
**
** If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then 
** [SQLITE_ROW] is returned each time a new row of data is ready
** for processing by the caller. The values may be accessed using
** the [sqlite3_column_int | column access functions].
** sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
** 
** [SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
** violation) has occurred.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on
** the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite3_errmsg()].
** With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (example:
** [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
** can be obtained by calling [sqlite3_reset()] on the
** [prepared statement].  In the "v2" interface,
** the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite3_step().
**
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
** Perhaps it was called on a [prepared statement] that has
** already been [sqlite3_finalize | finalized] or on one that had 
** previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
** be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
** more threads at the same moment in time.
**
** <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b>
** In the legacy interface, 
** the sqlite3_step() API always returns a generic error code,
** [SQLITE_ERROR], following any error other than [SQLITE_BUSY]
** and [SQLITE_MISUSE].  You must call [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] in order to find one of the specific
** [error codes] that better describes the error.
** We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed
** with the "v2" interface.  If you prepare all of your SQL statements
** using either [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] instead
** of the legacy [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()], then the 
** more specific [error codes] are returned directly
** by sqlite3_step().  The use of the "v2" interface is recommended.

** INVARIANTS:

** {F13202}  If [prepared statement] S is ready to be

**           row of the result set or an interrupt or run-time error occurs.
**
** {F15304}  When a call to [sqlite3_step(S)] causes the

**           the function returns [SQLITE_DONE].
**

** CAPI3REF: Results Values From A Query {F13800}
**
** These routines form the "result set query" interface.
**
** These routines return information about
** a single column of the current result row of a query.  In every
** case the first argument is a pointer to the 
** [prepared statement] that is being
** evaluated (the [sqlite3_stmt*] that was returned from 
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or one of its variants) and
** the second argument is the index of the column for which information 
** should be returned.  The left-most column of the result set
** has an index of 0.
**
** If the SQL statement is not currently point to a valid row, or if the
** the column index is out of range, the result is undefined. 
** These routines may only be called when the most recent call to
** [sqlite3_step()] has returned [SQLITE_ROW] and neither
** [sqlite3_reset()] nor [sqlite3_finalize()] has been call subsequently.
** If any of these routines are called after [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] or after [sqlite3_step()] has returned
** something other than [SQLITE_ROW], the results are undefined.
** If [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()]
** are called from a different thread while any of these routines
** are pending, then the results are undefined.  
**
** The sqlite3_column_type() routine returns 
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype code] for the initial data type
** of the result column.  The returned value is one of [SQLITE_INTEGER],
** [SQLITE_FLOAT], [SQLITE_TEXT], [SQLITE_BLOB], or [SQLITE_NULL].  The value
** returned by sqlite3_column_type() is only meaningful if no type
** conversions have occurred as described below.  After a type conversion,
** the value returned by sqlite3_column_type() is undefined.  Future
** versions of SQLite may change the behavior of sqlite3_column_type()
** following a type conversion.
**
** If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes() 
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** If the result is a UTF-16 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes() converts
** the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes.
** If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** The value returned does not include the zero terminator at the end
** of the string.  For clarity: the value returned is the number of
** bytes in the string, not the number of characters.
**
** Strings returned by sqlite3_column_text() and sqlite3_column_text16(),
** even empty strings, are always zero terminated.  The return
** value from sqlite3_column_blob() for a zero-length blob is an arbitrary
** pointer, possibly even a NULL pointer.
**
** The sqlite3_column_bytes16() routine is similar to sqlite3_column_bytes()
** but leaves the result in UTF-16 in native byte order instead of UTF-8.  
** The zero terminator is not included in this count.
**
** The object returned by [sqlite3_column_value()] is an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object.  An unprotected sqlite3_value object
** may only be used with [sqlite3_bind_value()] and [sqlite3_result_value()].
** If the [unprotected sqlite3_value] object returned by
** [sqlite3_column_value()] is used in any other way, including calls
** to routines like 
** [sqlite3_value_int()], [sqlite3_value_text()], or [sqlite3_value_bytes()],
** then the behavior is undefined.
**
** These routines attempt to convert the value where appropriate.  For
** example, if the internal representation is FLOAT and a text result
** is requested, [sqlite3_snprintf()] is used internally to do the conversion
** automatically.  The following table details the conversions that
** are applied:
**
** <blockquote>
** <table border="1">
** <tr><th> Internal<br>Type <th> Requested<br>Type <th>  Conversion
**
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td> INTEGER   <td> Result is 0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Result is 0.0
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   TEXT    <td> Result is NULL pointer
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   BLOB    <td> Result is NULL pointer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert from integer to float
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the integer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   BLOB    <td> Same as for INTEGER->TEXT
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td> INTEGER   <td> Convert from float to integer
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the float
** <tr><td>  FLOAT   <td>   BLOB    <td> Same as FLOAT->TEXT
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td> INTEGER   <td> Use atoi()
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Use atof()
** <tr><td>  TEXT    <td>   BLOB    <td> No change
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td> INTEGER   <td> Convert to TEXT then use atoi()
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert to TEXT then use atof()
** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>   TEXT    <td> Add a zero terminator if needed
** </table>
** </blockquote>
**
** The table above makes reference to standard C library functions atoi()
** and atof().  SQLite does not really use these functions.  It has its
** on equavalent internal routines.  The atoi() and atof() names are
** used in the table for brevity and because they are familiar to most
** C programmers.
**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or
** sqlite3_column_text16() may be invalidated. 
** Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
** in the following cases:
**
** <ul>
** <li><p>  The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite3_column_text() 
**          or sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**          need to be added to the string.</p></li>
**
** <li><p>  The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite3_column_bytes16() or
**          sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**          to UTF-16.</p></li>
**
** <li><p>  The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite3_column_bytes() or
**          sqlite3_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**          to UTF-8.</p></li>
** </ul>
**
** Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer points to will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometime it is
** not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.  
**
** The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
**  <ul>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_blob() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text16() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes16()</li>
**  </ul>
**
** In other words, you should call sqlite3_column_text(), sqlite3_column_blob(),
** or sqlite3_column_text16() first to force the result into the desired
** format, then invoke sqlite3_column_bytes() or sqlite3_column_bytes16() to
** find the size of the result.  Do not mix call to sqlite3_column_text() or
** sqlite3_column_blob() with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes16().  And do not
** mix calls to sqlite3_column_text16() with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes().
**
** The pointers returned are valid until a type conversion occurs as
** described above, or until [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] is called.  The memory space used to hold strings
** and blobs is freed automatically.  Do <b>not</b> pass the pointers returned
** [sqlite3_column_blob()], [sqlite3_column_text()], etc. into 
** [sqlite3_free()].
**
** If a memory allocation error occurs during the evaluation of any
** of these routines, a default value is returned.  The default value
** is either the integer 0, the floating point number 0.0, or a NULL
** pointer.  Subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] will return
** [SQLITE_NOMEM].

**
** The third parameter is the number of arguments that the SQL function or

**
** The fourth parameter, eTextRep, specifies what

** work with UTF-8, UTF-16le, or UTF-16be.  But some implementations may be
** more efficient with one encoding than another.  It is allowed to
** invoke sqlite3_create_function() or sqlite3_create_function16() multiple
** times with the same function but with different values of eTextRep.
** When multiple implementations of the same function are available, SQLite
** will pick the one that involves the least amount of data conversion.

**
** The seventh, eighth and ninth parameters, xFunc, xStep and xFinal, are

** existing SQL function or aggregate, pass NULL for all three function
** callback.

** CAPI3REF: Obtaining SQL Function Parameter Values {F15100}
**
** The C-language implementation of SQL functions and aggregates uses
** this set of interface routines to access the parameter values on
** the function or aggregate.
**
** The xFunc (for scalar functions) or xStep (for aggregates) parameters
** to [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** define callbacks that implement the SQL functions and aggregates.
** The 4th parameter to these callbacks is an array of pointers to
** [protected sqlite3_value] objects.  There is one [sqlite3_value] object for
** each parameter to the SQL function.  These routines are used to
** extract values from the [sqlite3_value] objects.
**
** These routines work only with [protected sqlite3_value] objects.
** Any attempt to use these routines on an [unprotected sqlite3_value]
** object results in undefined behavior.
**
** These routines work just like the corresponding 
** [sqlite3_column_blob | sqlite3_column_* routines] except that 
** these routines take a single [protected sqlite3_value] object pointer
** instead of an [sqlite3_stmt*] pointer and an integer column number.
**
** The sqlite3_value_text16() interface extracts a UTF16 string
** in the native byte-order of the host machine.  The
** sqlite3_value_text16be() and sqlite3_value_text16le() interfaces
** extract UTF16 strings as big-endian and little-endian respectively.
**
** The sqlite3_value_numeric_type() interface attempts to apply
** numeric affinity to the value.  This means that an attempt is
** made to convert the value to an integer or floating point.  If
** such a conversion is possible without loss of information (in other
** words if the value is a string that looks like a number)
** then the conversion is done.  Otherwise no conversion occurs.  The 
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype] after conversion is returned.
**
** Please pay particular attention to the fact that the pointer that
** is returned from [sqlite3_value_blob()], [sqlite3_value_text()], or
** [sqlite3_value_text16()] can be invalidated by a subsequent call to
** [sqlite3_value_bytes()], [sqlite3_value_bytes16()], [sqlite3_value_text()],
** or [sqlite3_value_text16()].

** These routines must be called from the same thread as
** the SQL function that supplied the [sqlite3_value*] parameters.

**
** These routines are used by the xFunc or xFinal callbacks that
** implement SQL functions and aggregates.  See
** [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** for additional information.
**
** These functions work very much like the 
** [sqlite3_bind_blob | sqlite3_bind_*] family of functions used
** to bind values to host parameters in prepared statements.
** Refer to the
** [sqlite3_bind_blob | sqlite3_bind_* documentation] for
** additional information.
**
** The sqlite3_result_blob() interface sets the result from
** an application defined function to be the BLOB whose content is pointed
** to by the second parameter and which is N bytes long where N is the
** third parameter. 
** The sqlite3_result_zeroblob() inerfaces set the result of
** the application defined function to be a BLOB containing all zero
** bytes and N bytes in size, where N is the value of the 2nd parameter.
**
** The sqlite3_result_double() interface sets the result from
** an application defined function to be a floating point value specified
** by its 2nd argument.
**
** The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16() functions
** cause the implemented SQL function to throw an exception.
** SQLite uses the string pointed to by the
** 2nd parameter of sqlite3_result_error() or sqlite3_result_error16()
** as the text of an error message.  SQLite interprets the error
** message string from sqlite3_result_error() as UTF8. SQLite
** interprets the string from sqlite3_result_error16() as UTF16 in native
** byte order.  If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() is negative then SQLite takes as the error
** message all text up through the first zero character.
** If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error() or
** sqlite3_result_error16() is non-negative then SQLite takes that many
** bytes (not characters) from the 2nd parameter as the error message.
** The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16()
** routines make a copy private copy of the error message text before
** they return.  Hence, the calling function can deallocate or
** modify the text after they return without harm.
** The sqlite3_result_error_code() function changes the error code
** returned by SQLite as a result of an error in a function.  By default,
** the error code is SQLITE_ERROR.  A subsequent call to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() resets the error code to SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** The sqlite3_result_toobig() interface causes SQLite
** to throw an error indicating that a string or BLOB is to long
** to represent.  The sqlite3_result_nomem() interface
** causes SQLite to throw an exception indicating that the a
** memory allocation failed.
**
** The sqlite3_result_int() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 32-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
** The sqlite3_result_int64() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 64-bit signed integer

** CAPI3REF: Define New Collating Sequences {F16600}
**
** These functions are used to add new collation sequences to the
** [sqlite3*] handle specified as the first argument. 
**
** The name of the new collation sequence is specified as a UTF-8 string
** for sqlite3_create_collation() and sqlite3_create_collation_v2()
** and a UTF-16 string for sqlite3_create_collation16(). In all cases
** the name is passed as the second function argument.
**
** The third argument may be one of the constants [SQLITE_UTF8],
** [SQLITE_UTF16LE] or [SQLITE_UTF16BE], indicating that the user-supplied
** routine expects to be passed pointers to strings encoded using UTF-8,
** UTF-16 little-endian or UTF-16 big-endian respectively. The
** third argument might also be [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED] to indicate that
** the routine expects pointers to 16-bit word aligned strings
** of UTF16 in the native byte order of the host computer.
**
** A pointer to the user supplied routine must be passed as the fifth
** argument.  If it is NULL, this is the same as deleting the collation
** sequence (so that SQLite cannot call it anymore).
** Each time the application
** supplied function is invoked, it is passed a copy of the void* passed as
** the fourth argument to sqlite3_create_collation() or
** sqlite3_create_collation16() as its first parameter.
**
** The remaining arguments to the application-supplied routine are two strings,
** each represented by a (length, data) pair and encoded in the encoding
** that was passed as the third argument when the collation sequence was
** registered. {END} The application defined collation routine should
** return negative, zero or positive if
** the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second
** string. i.e. (STRING1 - STRING2).
**
** The sqlite3_create_collation_v2() works like sqlite3_create_collation()
** excapt that it takes an extra argument which is a destructor for
** the collation.  The destructor is called when the collation is
** destroyed and is passed a copy of the fourth parameter void* pointer
** of the sqlite3_create_collation_v2().
** Collations are destroyed when
** they are overridden by later calls to the collation creation functions
** or when the [sqlite3*] database handle is closed using [sqlite3_close()].

**          implement collation X on [database connection] B for
**          databases having encoding E.
**
** {F16604} SQLite understands the X parameter to
**          [sqlite3_create_collation_v2(B,X,E,P,F,D)] as a zero-terminated
**          UTF-8 string in which case is ignored for ASCII characters and
**          is significant for non-ASCII characters.
**
** {F16606} Successive calls to [sqlite3_create_collation_v2(B,X,E,P,F,D)]
**          with the same values for B, X, and E, override prior values
**          of P, F, and D.
**
** {F16609} The destructor D in [sqlite3_create_collation_v2(B,X,E,P,F,D)]
**          is not NULL then it is called with argument P when the
**          collating function is dropped by SQLite.
**
** {F16612} A collating function is dropped when it is overloaded.
**
** {F16615} A collating function is dropped when the database connection
**          is closed using [sqlite3_close()].
**
** {F16618} The pointer P in [sqlite3_create_collation_v2(B,X,E,P,F,D)]
**          is passed through as the first parameter to the comparison
**          function F for all subsequent invocations of F.
**
** {F16621} A call to [sqlite3_create_collation(B,X,E,P,F)] is exactly
**          the same as a call to [sqlite3_create_collation_v2()] with
**          the same parameters and a NULL destructor.
**
** {F16624} Following a [sqlite3_create_collation_v2(B,X,E,P,F,D)],
**          SQLite uses the comparison function F for all text comparison
**          operations on [database connection] B on text values that
**          use the collating sequence name X.
**
** {F16627} The [sqlite3_create_collation16(B,X,E,P,F)] works the same
**          as [sqlite3_create_collation(B,X,E,P,F)] except that the
**          collation name X is understood as UTF-16 in native byte order
**          instead of UTF-8.
**
** {F16630} When multiple comparison functions are available for the same
**          collating sequence, SQLite chooses the one whose text encoding
**          requires the least amount of conversion from the default
**          text encoding of the database.

** Where OP is =, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, or &gt;=.

** Information about the ORDER BY clause is stored in aOrderBy[].
** Each term of aOrderBy records a column of the ORDER BY clause.

** CAPI3REF: Mutexes {F17000}
**
** The SQLite core uses these routines for thread
** synchronization.  Though they are intended for internal
** use by SQLite, code that links against SQLite is
** permitted to use any of these routines.
**
** The SQLite source code contains multiple implementations 
** of these mutex routines.  An appropriate implementation
** is selected automatically at compile-time.  The following
** implementations are available in the SQLite core:
**
** <ul>
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_OS2
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREAD
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_W32
** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP
** </ul>
**
** The SQLITE_MUTEX_NOOP implementation is a set of routines 
** that does no real locking and is appropriate for use in 
** a single-threaded application.  The SQLITE_MUTEX_OS2,
** SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREAD, and SQLITE_MUTEX_W32 implementations
** are appropriate for use on os/2, unix, and windows.
** 
** If SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF preprocessor
** macro defined (with "-DSQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF=1"), then no mutex
** implementation is included with the library.  The
** mutex interface routines defined here become external
** references in the SQLite library for which implementations
** must be provided by the application.  This facility allows an
** application that links against SQLite to provide its own mutex
** implementation without having to modify the SQLite core.
**
** {F17011} The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it. {F17012} If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated. {F17013} SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error. {F17014} The argument
** to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() is one of these integer constants:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM2
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU2
** </ul> {END}
**
** {F17015} The first two constants cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used. {END}
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  {F17016} But SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  {END} If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** {F17017} The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex. {END}  Four static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
** use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** {F17018} Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  {F17034} But for the static 
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has
** the same type number. {END}
**
** {F17019} The sqlite3_mutex_free() routine deallocates a previously
** allocated dynamic mutex. {F17020} SQLite is careful to deallocate every
** dynamic mutex that it allocates. {U17021} The dynamic mutexes must not be in 
** use when they are deallocated. {U17022} Attempting to deallocate a static
** mutex results in undefined behavior. {F17023} SQLite never deallocates
** a static mutex. {END}
**
** The sqlite3_mutex_enter() and sqlite3_mutex_try() routines attempt
** to enter a mutex. {F17024} If another thread is already within the mutex,
** sqlite3_mutex_enter() will block and sqlite3_mutex_try() will return
** SQLITE_BUSY. {F17025}  The sqlite3_mutex_try() interface returns SQLITE_OK
** upon successful entry.  {F17026} Mutexes created using
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE can be entered multiple times by the same thread.
** {F17027} In such cases the,
** mutex must be exited an equal number of times before another thread
** can enter.  {U17028} If the same thread tries to enter any other

** File Locking Notes:  (Mostly about windows but also some info for Unix)
**
** We cannot use LockFileEx() or UnlockFileEx() on Win95/98/ME because
** those functions are not available.  So we use only LockFile() and
** UnlockFile().
**
** LockFile() prevents not just writing but also reading by other processes.
** A SHARED_LOCK is obtained by locking a single randomly-chosen 
** byte out of a specific range of bytes. The lock byte is obtained at 
** random so two separate readers can probably access the file at the 
** same time, unless they are unlucky and choose the same lock byte.
** An EXCLUSIVE_LOCK is obtained by locking all bytes in the range.
** There can only be one writer.  A RESERVED_LOCK is obtained by locking
** a single byte of the file that is designated as the reserved lock byte.
** A PENDING_LOCK is obtained by locking a designated byte different from
** the RESERVED_LOCK byte.
**
** On WinNT/2K/XP systems, LockFileEx() and UnlockFileEx() are available,
** which means we can use reader/writer locks.  When reader/writer locks
** are used, the lock is placed on the same range of bytes that is used
** for probabilistic locking in Win95/98/ME.  Hence, the locking scheme
** will support two or more Win95 readers or two or more WinNT readers.
** But a single Win95 reader will lock out all WinNT readers and a single
** WinNT reader will lock out all other Win95 readers.
**
** The following #defines specify the range of bytes used for locking.
** SHARED_SIZE is the number of bytes available in the pool from which
** a random byte is selected for a shared lock.  The pool of bytes for
** shared locks begins at SHARED_FIRST. 
**
** These #defines are available in sqlite_aux.h so that adaptors for
** connecting SQLite to other operating systems can use the same byte
** ranges for locking.  In particular, the same locking strategy and
** byte ranges are used for Unix.  This leaves open the possiblity of having
** clients on win95, winNT, and unix all talking to the same shared file
** and all locking correctly.  To do so would require that samba (or whatever
** tool is being used for file sharing) implements locks correctly between
** windows and unix.  I'm guessing that isn't likely to happen, but by
** using the same locking range we are at least open to the possibility.
**
** Locking in windows is manditory.  For this reason, we cannot store
** actual data in the bytes used for locking.  The pager never allocates
** the pages involved in locking therefore.  SHARED_SIZE is selected so
** that all locks will fit on a single page even at the minimum page size.
** PENDING_BYTE defines the beginning of the locks.  By default PENDING_BYTE
** is set high so that we don't have to allocate an unused page except
** for very large databases.  But one should test the page skipping logic 
** by setting PENDING_BYTE low and running the entire regression suite.
**
** Changing the value of PENDING_BYTE results in a subtly incompatible
** file format.  Depending on how it is changed, you might not notice
** the incompatibility right away, even running a full regression test.
** The default location of PENDING_BYTE is the first byte past the
** 1GB boundary.

** update can proceed.  Processing continues and no error is reported.

** as opcodes here.  For example, the parser defines TK_GE to be an integer
** code representing the ">=" operator.  This same integer code is reused
** to represent the greater-than-or-equal-to operator in the expression
** tree.
**
** Expr.pRight and Expr.pLeft are subexpressions.  Expr.pList is a list
** of argument if the expression is a function.
**
** Expr.token is the operator token for this node.  For some expressions
** that have subexpressions, Expr.token can be the complete text that gave
** rise to the Expr.  In the latter case, the token is marked as being
** a compound token.
**
** An expression of the form ID or ID.ID refers to a column in a table.
** For such expressions, Expr.op is set to TK_COLUMN and Expr.iTable is
** the integer cursor number of a VDBE cursor pointing to that table and
** Expr.iColumn is the column number for the specific column.  If the
** expression is used as a result in an aggregate SELECT, then the
** value is also stored in the Expr.iAgg column in the aggregate so that
** it can be accessed after all aggregates are computed.
**
** If the expression is a function, the Expr.iTable is an integer code
** representing which function.  If the expression is an unbound variable
** marker (a question mark character '?' in the original SQL) then the
** Expr.iTable holds the index number for that variable.
**
** If the expression is a subquery then Expr.iColumn holds an integer
** register number containing the result of the subquery.  If the
** subquery gives a constant result, then iTable is -1.  If the subquery
** gives a different answer at different times during statement processing
** then iTable is the address of a subroutine that computes the subquery.
**
** The Expr.pSelect field points to a SELECT statement.  The SELECT might
** be the right operand of an IN operator.  Or, if a scalar SELECT appears
** in an expression the opcode is TK_SELECT and Expr.pSelect is the only
** operand.
**
** If the Expr is of type OP_Column, and the table it is selecting from
** is a disk table or the "old.*" pseudo-table, then pTab points to the
** corresponding table definition.

** SQLite processes all times and dates as Julian Day numbers.  The
** dates and times are stored as the number of days since noon
** in Greenwich on November 24, 4714 B.C. according to the Gregorian
** calendar system. 
**
** 1970-01-01 00:00:00 is JD 2440587.5
** 2000-01-01 00:00:00 is JD 2451544.5
**
** This implemention requires years to be expressed as a 4-digit number
** which means that only dates between 0000-01-01 and 9999-12-31 can
** be represented, even though julian day numbers allow a much wider
** range of dates.
**
** The Gregorian calendar system is used for all dates and times,
** even those that predate the Gregorian calendar.  Historians usually
** use the Julian calendar for dates prior to 1582-10-15 and for some
** dates afterwards, depending on locale.  Beware of this difference.
**
** The conversion algorithms are implemented based on descriptions
** in the following text:

/*
** A memory allocation (also called a "chunk") consists of two or 
** more blocks where each block is 8 bytes.  The first 8 bytes are 
** a header that is not returned to the user.
**
** A chunk is two or more blocks that is either checked out or
** free.  The first block has format u.hdr.  u.hdr.size4x is 4 times the
** size of the allocation in blocks if the allocation is free.
** The u.hdr.size4x&1 bit is true if the chunk is checked out and
** false if the chunk is on the freelist.  The u.hdr.size4x&2 bit
** is true if the previous chunk is checked out and false if the
** previous chunk is free.  The u.hdr.prevSize field is the size of
** the previous chunk in blocks if the previous chunk is on the
** freelist. If the previous chunk is checked out, then
** u.hdr.prevSize can be part of the data for that chunk and should
** not be read or written.
**
** We often identify a chunk by its index in mem.aPool[].  When
** this is done, the chunk index refers to the second block of
** the chunk.  In this way, the first chunk has an index of 1.
** A chunk index of 0 means "no such chunk" and is the equivalent
** of a NULL pointer.
**
** The second block of free chunks is of the form u.list.  The
** two fields form a double-linked list of chunks of related sizes.
** Pointers to the head of the list are stored in mem.aiSmall[] 
** for smaller chunks and mem.aiHash[] for larger chunks.
**
** The second block of a chunk is user data if the chunk is checked 
** out.  If a chunk is checked out, the user data may extend into
** the u.hdr.prevSize value of the following chunk.

** The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it.  If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated.  SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error.  The argument
** to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() is one of these integer constants:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST               0
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE          1

** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM         3
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG        4
** </ul>
**
** The first two constants cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used.
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  But SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex.  Three static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
** use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  But for the static 
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has

** out so that the functionality is now the same as standard printf().
**
**************************************************************************
**
** The following modules is an enhanced replacement for the "printf" subroutines
** found in the standard C library.  The following enhancements are

**
**      +  Additional functions.  The standard set of "printf" functions
**         includes printf, fprintf, sprintf, vprintf, vfprintf, and
**         vsprintf.  This module adds the following:
**
**           *  snprintf -- Works like sprintf, but has an extra argument
**                          which is the size of the buffer written to.
**
**           *  mprintf --  Similar to sprintf.  Writes output to memory
**                          obtained from malloc.
**
**           *  xprintf --  Calls a function to dispose of output.
**
**           *  nprintf --  No output, but returns the number of characters
**                          that would have been output by printf.
**
**           *  A v- version (ex: vsnprintf) of every function is also
**              supplied.
**
**      +  A few extensions to the formatting notation are supported:
**
**           *  The "=" flag (similar to "-") causes the output to be
**              be centered in the appropriately sized field.
**
**           *  The %b field outputs an integer in binary notation.
**
**           *  The %c field now accepts a precision.  The character output
**              is repeated by the number of times the precision specifies.
**
**           *  The %' field works like %c, but takes as its character the
**              next character of the format string, instead of the next
**              argument.  For example,  printf("%.78'-")  prints 78 minus
**              signs, the same as  printf("%.78c",'-').
**
**      +  When compiled using GCC on a SPARC, this version of printf is
**         faster than the library printf for SUN OS 4.1.
**
**      +  All functions are fully reentrant.

**            2. A pointer to the list of characters to be output

**            3. An integer number of characters to be output.
**               (Note: This number might be zero.)
**
**   arg    This is the pointer to anything which will be passed as the
**          first argument to "func".  Use it for whatever you like.
**
**   fmt    This is the format string, as in the usual print.
**
**   ap     This is a pointer to a list of arguments.  Same as in
**          vfprint.
**
** OUTPUTS:
**          The return value is the total number of characters sent to
**          the function "func".  Returns -1 on a error.
**
** Note that the order in which automatic variables are declared below

/*
** A Note About Memory Allocation:
**
** This driver uses malloc()/free() directly rather than going through
** the SQLite-wrappers sqlite3_malloc()/sqlite3_free().  Those wrappers
** are designed for use on embedded systems where memory is scarce and
** malloc failures happen frequently.  OS/2 does not typically run on
** embedded systems, and when it does the developers normally have bigger
** problems to worry about than running out of memory.  So there is not
** a compelling need to use the wrappers.
**
** But there is a good reason to not use the wrappers.  If we use the
** wrappers then we will get simulated malloc() failures within this
** driver.  And that causes all kinds of problems for our tests.  We
** could enhance SQLite to deal with simulated malloc failures within
** the OS driver, but the code to deal with those failure would not
** be exercised on Linux (which does not need to malloc() in the driver)
** and so we would have difficulty writing coverage tests for that
** code.  Better to leave the code out, we think.
**
** The point of this discussion is as follows:  When creating a new
** OS layer for an embedded system, if you use this file as an example,
** avoid the use of malloc()/free().  Those routines work ok on OS/2
** desktops but not so well in embedded systems.

** Here is the dirt on POSIX advisory locks:  ANSI STD 1003.1 (1996)
** section 6.5.2.2 lines 483 through 490 specify that when a process
** sets or clears a lock, that operation overrides any prior locks set
** by the same process.  It does not explicitly say so, but this implies
** that it overrides locks set by the same process using a different
** file descriptor.  Consider this test case:
**
**       int fd1 = open("./file1", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644);
**       int fd2 = open("./file2", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0644);
**
** Suppose ./file1 and ./file2 are really the same file (because
** one is a hard or symbolic link to the other) then if you set
** an exclusive lock on fd1, then try to get an exclusive lock
** on fd2, it works.  I would have expected the second lock to
** fail since there was already a lock on the file due to fd1.
** But not so.  Since both locks came from the same process, the
** second overrides the first, even though they were on different
** file descriptors opened on different file names.
**
** Bummer.  If you ask me, this is broken.  Badly broken.  It means
** that we cannot use POSIX locks to synchronize file access among
** competing threads of the same process.  POSIX locks will work fine
** to synchronize access for threads in separate processes, but not
** threads within the same process.
**
** To work around the problem, SQLite has to manage file locks internally
** on its own.  Whenever a new database is opened, we have to find the
** specific inode of the database file (the inode is determined by the
** st_dev and st_ino fields of the stat structure that fstat() fills in)
** and check for locks already existing on that inode.  When locks are
** created or removed, we have to look at our own internal record of the
** locks to see if another thread has previously set a lock on that same
** inode.
**
** The sqlite3_file structure for POSIX is no longer just an integer file
** descriptor.  It is now a structure that holds the integer file
** descriptor and a pointer to a structure that describes the internal
** locks on the corresponding inode.  There is one locking structure
** per inode, so if the same inode is opened twice, both unixFile structures
** point to the same locking structure.  The locking structure keeps
** a reference count (so we will know when to delete it) and a "cnt"
** field that tells us its internal lock status.  cnt==0 means the
** file is unlocked.  cnt==-1 means the file has an exclusive lock.
** cnt>0 means there are cnt shared locks on the file.
**
** Any attempt to lock or unlock a file first checks the locking
** structure.  The fcntl() system call is only invoked to set a 
** POSIX lock if the internal lock structure transitions between
** a locked and an unlocked state.
**
** 2004-Jan-11:
** More recent discoveries about POSIX advisory locks.  (The more
** I discover, the more I realize the a POSIX advisory locks are
** an abomination.)
**
** If you close a file descriptor that points to a file that has locks,
** all locks on that file that are owned by the current process are
** released.  To work around this problem, each unixFile structure contains
** a pointer to an openCnt structure.  There is one openCnt structure
** per open inode, which means that multiple unixFile can point to a single
** openCnt.  When an attempt is made to close an unixFile, if there are
** other unixFile open on the same inode that are holding locks, the call
** to close() the file descriptor is deferred until all of the locks clear.
** The openCnt structure keeps a list of file descriptors that need to
** be closed and that list is walked (and cleared) when the last lock
** clears.
**
** First, under Linux threads, because each thread has a separate
** process ID, lock operations in one thread do not override locks
** to the same file in other threads.  Linux threads behave like
** separate processes in this respect.  But, if you close a file
** descriptor in linux threads, all locks are cleared, even locks
** on other threads and even though the other threads have different
** process IDs.  Linux threads is inconsistent in this respect.
** (I'm beginning to think that linux threads is an abomination too.)
** The consequence of this all is that the hash table for the lockInfo
** structure has to include the process id as part of its key because
** locks in different threads are treated as distinct.  But the 
** openCnt structure should not include the process id in its
** key because close() clears lock on all threads, not just the current
** thread.  Were it not for this goofiness in linux threads, we could
** combine the lockInfo and openCnt structures into a single structure.
**
** 2004-Jun-28:
** On some versions of linux, threads can override each others locks.
** On others not.  Sometimes you can change the behavior on the same
** system by setting the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL environment variable.  The
** POSIX standard is silent as to which behavior is correct, as far
** as I can tell, so other versions of unix might show the same
** inconsistency.  There is no little doubt in my mind that posix
** advisory locks and linux threads are profoundly broken.
**
** To work around the inconsistencies, we have to test at runtime 
** whether or not threads can override each others locks.  This test
** is run once, the first time any lock is attempted.  A static 
** variable is set to record the results of this test for future
** use.

  ** lock primitives (called read-locks and write-locks below, to avoid
  ** confusion with SQLite lock names). The algorithms are complicated
  ** slightly in order to be compatible with windows systems simultaneously
  ** accessing the same database file, in case that is ever required.
  **
  ** Symbols defined in os.h indentify the 'pending byte' and the 'reserved
  ** byte', each single bytes at well known offsets, and the 'shared byte
  ** range', a range of 510 bytes at a well known offset.
  **
  ** To obtain a SHARED lock, a read-lock is obtained on the 'pending
  ** byte'.  If this is successful, a random byte from the 'shared byte
  ** range' is read-locked and the lock on the 'pending byte' released.
  **
  ** A process may only obtain a RESERVED lock after it has a SHARED lock.
  ** A RESERVED lock is implemented by grabbing a write-lock on the
  ** 'reserved byte'. 
  **
  ** A process may only obtain a PENDING lock after it has obtained a
  ** SHARED lock. A PENDING lock is implemented by obtaining a write-lock
  ** on the 'pending byte'. This ensures that no new SHARED locks can be
  ** obtained, but existing SHARED locks are allowed to persist. A process
  ** does not have to obtain a RESERVED lock on the way to a PENDING lock.
  ** This property is used by the algorithm for rolling back a journal file
  ** after a crash.
  **
  ** An EXCLUSIVE lock, obtained after a PENDING lock is held, is
  ** implemented by obtaining a write-lock on the entire 'shared byte
  ** range'. Since all other locks require a read-lock on one of the bytes
  ** within this range, this ensures that no other locks are held on the
  ** database. 
  **
  ** The reason a single byte cannot be used instead of the 'shared byte
  ** range' is that some versions of windows do not support read-locks. By
  ** locking a random byte from a range, concurrent SHARED locks may exist
  ** even if the locking primitive used is always a write-lock.

** A Note About Memory Allocation:
**
** This driver uses malloc()/free() directly rather than going through
** the SQLite-wrappers sqlite3_malloc()/sqlite3_free().  Those wrappers
** are designed for use on embedded systems where memory is scarce and
** malloc failures happen frequently.  Win32 does not typically run on
** embedded systems, and when it does the developers normally have bigger
** problems to worry about than running out of memory.  So there is not
** a compelling need to use the wrappers.
**
** But there is a good reason to not use the wrappers.  If we use the
** wrappers then we will get simulated malloc() failures within this
** driver.  And that causes all kinds of problems for our tests.  We
** could enhance SQLite to deal with simulated malloc failures within
** the OS driver, but the code to deal with those failure would not
** be exercised on Linux (which does not need to malloc() in the driver)
** and so we would have difficulty writing coverage tests for that
** code.  Better to leave the code out, we think.
**
** The point of this discussion is as follows:  When creating a new
** OS layer for an embedded system, if you use this file as an example,
** avoid the use of malloc()/free().  Those routines work ok on windows
** desktops but not so well in embedded systems.

** A bitmap is used to record what pages a database file have been
** journalled during a transaction.  Usually only a few pages are
** journalled.  So the bitmap is usually sparse and has low cardinality.
** But sometimes (for example when during a DROP of a large table) most
** or all of the pages get journalled.  In those cases, the bitmap becomes
** dense.  The algorithm needs to handle both cases well.
**
** The size of the bitmap is fixed when the object is created.
**
** All bits are clear when the bitmap is created.  Individual bits
** may be set or cleared one at a time.
**
** Test operations are about 100 times more common that set operations.
** Clear operations are exceedingly rare.  There are usually between
** 5 and 500 set operations per Bitvec object, though the number of sets can
** sometimes grow into tens of thousands or larger.  The size of the
** Bitvec object is the number of pages in the database file at the
** start of a transaction, and is thus usually less than a few thousand,
** but can be as large as 2 billion for a really big database.

**                       state.
**
**   PAGER_SHARED        The page cache is reading the database.
**                       Writing is not permitted.  There can be
**                       multiple readers accessing the same database
**                       file at the same time.
**
**   PAGER_RESERVED      This process has reserved the database for writing
**                       but has not yet made any changes.  Only one process
**                       at a time can reserve the database.  The original
**                       database file has not been modified so other
**                       processes may still be reading the on-disk
**                       database file.
**
**   PAGER_EXCLUSIVE     The page cache is writing the database.
**                       Access is exclusive.  No other processes or
**                       threads can be reading or writing while one
**                       process is writing.
**
**   PAGER_SYNCED        The pager moves to this state from PAGER_EXCLUSIVE
**                       after all dirty pages have been written to the
**                       database file and the file has been synced to
**                       disk. All that remains to do is to remove or
**                       truncate the journal file and the transaction 
**                       will be committed.
**
** The page cache comes up in PAGER_UNLOCK.  The first time a
** sqlite3PagerGet() occurs, the state transitions to PAGER_SHARED.
** After all pages have been released using sqlite_page_unref(),
** the state transitions back to PAGER_UNLOCK.  The first time

** PAGER_RESERVED.  (Note that sqlite3PagerWrite() can only be
** called on an outstanding page which means that the pager must
** be in PAGER_SHARED before it transitions to PAGER_RESERVED.)
** PAGER_RESERVED means that there is an open rollback journal.
** The transition to PAGER_EXCLUSIVE occurs before any changes
** are made to the database file, though writes to the rollback
** journal occurs with just PAGER_RESERVED.  After an sqlite3PagerRollback()

** is called, the original page contents are written into the rollback
** journal and PgHdr.inJournal and PgHdr.needSync are set.  Later, once
** the journal page has made it onto the disk surface, PgHdr.needSync
** is cleared.  The modified page cannot be written back into the original

** PgHdr.needSync has been cleared.
**
** The PgHdr.dirty flag is set when sqlite3PagerWrite() is called and
** is cleared again when the page content is written back to the original
** database file.
**
** Details of important structure elements:
**
** needSync
**
**     If this is true, this means that it is not safe to write the page
**     content to the database because the original content needed
**     for rollback has not by synced to the main rollback journal.
**     The original content may have been written to the rollback journal
**     but it has not yet been synced.  So we cannot write to the database
**     file because power failure might cause the page in the journal file
**     to never reach the disk.  It is as if the write to the journal file
**     does not occur until the journal file is synced.
**     
**     This flag is false if the page content exactly matches what
**     currently exists in the database file.  The needSync flag is also
**     false if the original content has been written to the main rollback
**     journal and synced.  If the page represents a new page that has
**     been added onto the end of the database during the current
**     transaction, the needSync flag is true until the original database
**     size in the journal header has been synced to disk.
**
** inJournal
**
**     This is true if the original page has been written into the main
**     rollback journal.  This is always false for new pages added to
**     the end of the database file during the current transaction.
**     And this flag says nothing about whether or not the journal
**     has been synced to disk.  For pages that are in the original
**     database file, the following expression should always be true:
**
**       inJournal = sqlite3BitvecTest(pPager->pInJournal, pgno)
**
**     The pPager->pInJournal object is only valid for the original
**     pages of the database, not new pages that are added to the end
**     of the database, so obviously the above expression cannot be
**     valid for new pages.  For new pages inJournal is always 0.
**
** dirty
**
**     When true, this means that the content of the page has been
**     modified and needs to be written back to the database file.
**     If false, it means that either the content of the page is
**     unchanged or else the content is unimportant and we do not
**     care whether or not it is preserved.
**
** alwaysRollback
**
**     This means that the sqlite3PagerDontRollback() API should be
**     ignored for this page.  The DontRollback() API attempts to say
**     that the content of the page on disk is unimportant (it is an
**     unused page on the freelist) so that it is unnecessary to 
**     rollback changes to this page because the content of the page
**     can change without changing the meaning of the database.  This
**     flag overrides any DontRollback() attempt.  This flag is set
**     when a page that originally contained valid data is added to
**     the freelist.  Later in the same transaction, this page might
**     be pulled from the freelist and reused for something different
**     and at that point the DontRollback() API will be called because
**     pages taken from the freelist do not need to be protected by
**     the rollback journal.  But this flag says that the page was
**     not originally part of the freelist so that it still needs to
**     be rolled back in spite of any subsequent DontRollback() calls.
**
** needRead 
**
**     This flag means (when true) that the content of the page has
**     not yet been loaded from disk.  The in-memory content is just
**     garbage.  (Actually, we zero the content, but you should not
**     make any assumptions about the content nevertheless.)  If the
**     content is needed in the future, it should be read from the
**     original database file.

**       in the journal.  If this value is 0xffffffff, then compute the
**       number of page records from the journal size.
**  (3)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the initial value for the 
**       sanity checksum.
**  (4)  4 byte integer which is the number of pages to truncate the
**       database to during a rollback.
**  (5)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the sector size.  The header
**       is this many bytes in size.
**  (6)  4 byte big-endian integer which is the page case.
**  (7)  4 byte integer which is the number of bytes in the master journal
**       name.  The value may be zero (indicate that there is no master
**       journal.)
**  (8)  N bytes of the master journal name.  The name will be nul-terminated
**       and might be shorter than the value read from (5).  If the first byte
**       of the name is \000 then there is no master journal.  The master
**       journal name is stored in UTF-8.
**  (9)  Zero or more pages instances, each as follows:
**        +  4 byte page number.
**        +  pPager->pageSize bytes of data.
**        +  4 byte checksum
**
** When we speak of the journal header, we mean the first 8 items above.
** Each entry in the journal is an instance of the 9th item.
**
** Call the value from the second bullet "nRec".  nRec is the number of
** valid page entries in the journal.  In most cases, you can compute the
** value of nRec from the size of the journal file.  But if a power
** failure occurred while the journal was being written, it could be the
** case that the size of the journal file had already been increased but
** the extra entries had not yet made it safely to disk.  In such a case,
** the value of nRec computed from the file size would be too large.  For
** that reason, we always use the nRec value in the header.
**
** If the nRec value is 0xffffffff it means that nRec should be computed
** from the file size.  This value is used when the user selects the
** no-sync option for the journal.  A power failure could lead to corruption
** in this case.  But for things like temporary table (which will be
** deleted when the power is restored) we don't care.  
**
** If the file opened as the journal file is not a well-formed
** journal file then all pages up to the first corrupted page are rolled
** back (or no pages if the journal header is corrupted). The journal file
** is then deleted and SQLITE_OK returned, just as if no corruption had
** been encountered.
**
** If an I/O or malloc() error occurs, the journal-file is not deleted
** and an error code is returned.

**    NORMAL    The journal is synced once before writes begin on the
**              database.  This is normally adequate protection, but
**              it is theoretically possible, though very unlikely,

**              when it is rolled back.
**
**    FULL      The journal is synced twice before writes begin on the
**              database (with some additional information - the nRec field
**              of the journal header - being written in between the two
**              syncs).  If we assume that writing a
**              single disk sector is atomic, then this mode provides
**              assurance that the journal will not be corrupted to the
**              point of causing damage to the database during rollback.
**
** Numeric values associated with these states are OFF==1, NORMAL=2,

**
** This file implements a external (disk-based) database using BTrees.
** For a detailed discussion of BTrees, refer to
**
**     Donald E. Knuth, THE ART OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING, Volume 3:
**     "Sorting And Searching", pages 473-480. Addison-Wesley
**     Publishing Company, Reading, Massachusetts.
**
** The basic idea is that each page of the file contains N database
** entries and N+1 pointers to subpages.
**
**   ----------------------------------------------------------------
**   |  Ptr(0) | Key(0) | Ptr(1) | Key(1) | ... | Key(N-1) | Ptr(N) |
**   ----------------------------------------------------------------
**
** All of the keys on the page that Ptr(0) points to have values less
** than Key(0).  All of the keys on page Ptr(1) and its subpages have
** values greater than Key(0) and less than Key(1).  All of the keys
** on Ptr(N) and its subpages have values greater than Key(N-1).  And
** so forth.
**
** Finding a particular key requires reading O(log(M)) pages from the 
** disk where M is the number of entries in the tree.
**
** In this implementation, a single file can hold one or more separate 
** BTrees.  Each BTree is identified by the index of its root page.  The
** key and data for any entry are combined to form the "payload".  A
** fixed amount of payload can be carried directly on the database
** page.  If the payload is larger than the preset amount then surplus
** bytes are stored on overflow pages.  The payload for an entry
** and the preceding pointer are combined to form a "Cell".  Each 
** page has a small header which contains the Ptr(N) pointer and other
** information such as the size of key and data.
**
** FORMAT DETAILS
**
** The file is divided into pages.  The first page is called page 1,
** the second is page 2, and so forth.  A page number of zero indicates
** "no such page".  The page size can be anything between 512 and 65536.
** Each page can be either a btree page, a freelist page or an overflow
** page.
**
** The first page is always a btree page.  The first 100 bytes of the first
** page contain a special header (the "file header") that describes the file.
** The format of the file header is as follows:
**
**   OFFSET   SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      0      16     Header string: "SQLite format 3\000"
**     16       2     Page size in bytes.  
**     18       1     File format write version
**     19       1     File format read version
**     20       1     Bytes of unused space at the end of each page
**     21       1     Max embedded payload fraction
**     22       1     Min embedded payload fraction
**     23       1     Min leaf payload fraction
**     24       4     File change counter
**     28       4     Reserved for future use
**     32       4     First freelist page
**     36       4     Number of freelist pages in the file
**     40      60     15 4-byte meta values passed to higher layers
**
** All of the integer values are big-endian (most significant byte first).
**
** The file change counter is incremented when the database is changed
** This counter allows other processes to know when the file has changed
** and thus when they need to flush their cache.
**
** The max embedded payload fraction is the amount of the total usable
** space in a page that can be consumed by a single cell for standard
** B-tree (non-LEAFDATA) tables.  A value of 255 means 100%.  The default
** is to limit the maximum cell size so that at least 4 cells will fit
** on one page.  Thus the default max embedded payload fraction is 64.
**
** If the payload for a cell is larger than the max payload, then extra
** payload is spilled to overflow pages.  Once an overflow page is allocated,
** as many bytes as possible are moved into the overflow pages without letting
** the cell size drop below the min embedded payload fraction.
**
** The min leaf payload fraction is like the min embedded payload fraction
** except that it applies to leaf nodes in a LEAFDATA tree.  The maximum
** payload fraction for a LEAFDATA tree is always 100% (or 255) and it
** not specified in the header.
**
** Each btree pages is divided into three sections:  The header, the
** cell pointer array, and the cell content area.  Page 1 also has a 100-byte
** file header that occurs before the page header.
**
**      |----------------|
**      | file header    |   100 bytes.  Page 1 only.
**      |----------------|
**      | page header    |   8 bytes for leaves.  12 bytes for interior nodes
**      |----------------|
**      | cell pointer   |   |  2 bytes per cell.  Sorted order.
**      | array          |   |  Grows downward
**      |                |   v
**      |----------------|
**      | unallocated    |
**      | space          |
**      |----------------|   ^  Grows upwards
**      | cell content   |   |  Arbitrary order interspersed with freeblocks.
**      | area           |   |  and free space fragments.
**      |----------------|
**
** The page headers looks like this:
**
**   OFFSET   SIZE     DESCRIPTION
**      0       1      Flags. 1: intkey, 2: zerodata, 4: leafdata, 8: leaf
**      1       2      byte offset to the first freeblock
**      3       2      number of cells on this page
**      5       2      first byte of the cell content area
**      7       1      number of fragmented free bytes
**      8       4      Right child (the Ptr(N) value).  Omitted on leaves.
**
** The flags define the format of this btree page.  The leaf flag means that
** this page has no children.  The zerodata flag means that this page carries
** only keys and no data.  The intkey flag means that the key is a integer
** which is stored in the key size entry of the cell header rather than in
** the payload area.
**
** The cell pointer array begins on the first byte after the page header.
** The cell pointer array contains zero or more 2-byte numbers which are
** offsets from the beginning of the page to the cell content in the cell
** content area.  The cell pointers occur in sorted order.  The system strives
** to keep free space after the last cell pointer so that new cells can
** be easily added without having to defragment the page.
**
** Cell content is stored at the very end of the page and grows toward the
** beginning of the page.
**
** Unused space within the cell content area is collected into a linked list of
** freeblocks.  Each freeblock is at least 4 bytes in size.  The byte offset
** to the first freeblock is given in the header.  Freeblocks occur in
** increasing order.  Because a freeblock must be at least 4 bytes in size,
** any group of 3 or fewer unused bytes in the cell content area cannot
** exist on the freeblock chain.  A group of 3 or fewer free bytes is called
** a fragment.  The total number of bytes in all fragments is recorded.
** in the page header at offset 7.
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      2     Byte offset of the next freeblock
**      2     Bytes in this freeblock
**
** Cells are of variable length.  Cells are stored in the cell content area at
** the end of the page.  Pointers to the cells are in the cell pointer array
** that immediately follows the page header.  Cells is not necessarily
** contiguous or in order, but cell pointers are contiguous and in order.
**
** Cell content makes use of variable length integers.  A variable
** length integer is 1 to 9 bytes where the lower 7 bits of each 
** byte are used.  The integer consists of all bytes that have bit 8 set and
** the first byte with bit 8 clear.  The most significant byte of the integer
** appears first.  A variable-length integer may not be more than 9 bytes long.
** As a special case, all 8 bytes of the 9th byte are used as data.  This
** allows a 64-bit integer to be encoded in 9 bytes.
**
**    0x00                      becomes  0x00000000
**    0x7f                      becomes  0x0000007f
**    0x81 0x00                 becomes  0x00000080
**    0x82 0x00                 becomes  0x00000100
**    0x80 0x7f                 becomes  0x0000007f
**    0x8a 0x91 0xd1 0xac 0x78  becomes  0x12345678
**    0x81 0x81 0x81 0x81 0x01  becomes  0x10204081
**
** Variable length integers are used for rowids and to hold the number of
** bytes of key and data in a btree cell.
**
** The content of a cell looks like this:
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      4     Page number of the left child. Omitted if leaf flag is set.
**     var    Number of bytes of data. Omitted if the zerodata flag is set.
**     var    Number of bytes of key. Or the key itself if intkey flag is set.
**      *     Payload
**      4     First page of the overflow chain.  Omitted if no overflow
**
** Overflow pages form a linked list.  Each page except the last is completely
** filled with data (pagesize - 4 bytes).  The last page can have as little
** as 1 byte of data.
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      4     Page number of next overflow page
**      *     Data
**
** Freelist pages come in two subtypes: trunk pages and leaf pages.  The
** file header points to the first in a linked list of trunk page.  Each trunk
** page points to multiple leaf pages.  The content of a leaf page is
** unspecified.  A trunk page looks like this:
**
**    SIZE    DESCRIPTION
**      4     Page number of next trunk page
**      4     Number of leaf pointers on this page
**      *     zero or more pages numbers of leaves

**
** Developers using SQLite on an ARM7 should compile and run their

** enabled, some asserts below will ensure that the byte order of

**
** (2007-08-30)  Frank van Vugt has studied this problem closely

** writes that some Linux kernels offer floating point hardware
** emulation that uses only 32-bit mantissas instead of a full 
** 48-bits as required by the IEEE standard.  (This is the
** CONFIG_FPE_FASTFPE option.)  On such systems, floating point
** byte swapping becomes very complicated.  To avoid problems,
** the necessary byte swapping is carried out using a 64-bit integer
** rather than a 64-bit float.  Frank assures us that the code here
** works for him.  We, the developers, have no way to independently
** verify this, but Frank seems to know what he is talking about

** Historical note: In earlier versions of this routine both Key1

*************************************************************************
** The code in this file implements execution method of the 
** Virtual Database Engine (VDBE).  A separate file ("vdbeaux.c")
** handles housekeeping details such as creating and deleting
** VDBE instances.  This file is solely interested in executing
** the VDBE program.
**
** In the external interface, an "sqlite3_stmt*" is an opaque pointer
** to a VDBE.
**
** The SQL parser generates a program which is then executed by
** the VDBE to do the work of the SQL statement.  VDBE programs are 
** similar in form to assembly language.  The program consists of
** a linear sequence of operations.  Each operation has an opcode 
** and 5 operands.  Operands P1, P2, and P3 are integers.  Operand P4 
** is a null-terminated string.  Operand P5 is an unsigned character.
** Few opcodes use all 5 operands.
**
** Computation results are stored on a set of registers numbered beginning
** with 1 and going up to Vdbe.nMem.  Each register can store
** either an integer, a null-terminated string, a floating point
** number, or the SQL "NULL" value.  An inplicit conversion from one
** type to the other occurs as necessary.
** 
** Most of the code in this file is taken up by the sqlite3VdbeExec()
** function which does the work of interpreting a VDBE program.
** But other routines are also provided to help in building up
** a program instruction by instruction.
**
** Various scripts scan this source file in order to generate HTML
** documentation, headers files, or other derived files.  The formatting
** of the code in this file is, therefore, important.  See other comments

** commenting and indentation practices when changing or adding code.

** invoke the result callback (if there is one) or return with
** SQLITE_ROW.
**
** If an attempt is made to open a locked database, then this routine
** will either invoke the busy callback (if there is one) or it will
** return SQLITE_BUSY.
**
** If an error occurs, an error message is written to memory obtained
** from sqlite3_malloc() and p->zErrMsg is made to point to that memory.
** The error code is stored in p->rc and this routine returns SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** If the callback ever returns non-zero, then the program exits
** immediately.  There will be no error message but the p->rc field is
** set to SQLITE_ABORT and this routine will return SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** A memory allocation error causes p->rc to be set to SQLITE_NOMEM and this
** routine to return SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** Other fatal errors return SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** After this routine has finished, sqlite3VdbeFinalize() should be
** used to clean up the mess that was left behind.

** What follows is a massive switch statement where each case implements a

** that is a lot of wasted space on the left margin.  So the code within
** the switch statement will break with convention and be flush-left. Another
** big comment (similar to this one) will mark the point in the code where
** we transition back to normal indentation.
**
** The formatting of each case is important.  The makefile for SQLite
** generates two C files "opcodes.h" and "opcodes.c" by scanning this
** file looking for lines that begin with "case OP_".  The opcodes.h files
** will be filled with #defines that give unique integer values to each
** opcode and the opcodes.c file is filled with an array of strings where
** each string is the symbolic name for the corresponding opcode.  If the
** case statement is followed by a comment of the form "/# same as ... #/"
** that comment is used to determine the particular value of the opcode.
**
** Other keywords in the comment that follows each case are used to
** construct the OPFLG_INITIALIZER value that initializes opcodeProperty[].
** Keywords include: in1, in2, in3, out2_prerelease, out2, out3.  See
** the mkopcodeh.awk script for additional information.
**
** Documentation about VDBE opcodes is generated by scanning this file

** Compare two UTF-8 strings for equality where the first string can

**
** Globbing rules:
**
**      '*'       Matches any sequence of zero or more characters.
**
**      '?'       Matches exactly one character.
**
**     [...]      Matches one character from the enclosed list of
**                characters.
**
**     [^...]     Matches one character not in the enclosed list.
**
** With the [...] and [^...] matching, a ']' character can be included
** in the list by making it the first character after '[' or '^'.  A
** range of characters can be specified using '-'.  Example:
** "[a-z]" matches any single lower-case letter.  To match a '-', make
** it the last character in the list.
**

**
** Hints: to match '*' or '?', put them in "[]".  Like this:
**
**         abc[*]xyz        Matches "abc*xyz" only

** This routine is call to handle SQL of the following forms:
**
**    insert into TABLE (IDLIST) values(EXPRLIST)
**    insert into TABLE (IDLIST) select
**
** The IDLIST following the table name is always optional.  If omitted,
** then a list of all columns for the table is substituted.  The IDLIST
** appears in the pColumn parameter.  pColumn is NULL if IDLIST is omitted.
**
** The pList parameter holds EXPRLIST in the first form of the INSERT
** statement above, and pSelect is NULL.  For the second form, pList is
** NULL and pSelect is a pointer to the select statement used to generate
** data for the insert.
**
** The code generated follows one of four templates.  For a simple
** select with data coming from a VALUES clause, the code executes
** once straight down through.  The template looks like this:
**
**         open write cursor to <table> and its indices
**         puts VALUES clause expressions onto the stack
**         write the resulting record into <table>
**         cleanup
**
** The three remaining templates assume the statement is of the form
**
**   INSERT INTO <table> SELECT ...
**
** If the SELECT clause is of the restricted form "SELECT * FROM <table2>" -
** in other words if the SELECT pulls all columns from a single table
** and there is no WHERE or LIMIT or GROUP BY or ORDER BY clauses, and
** if <table2> and <table1> are distinct tables but have identical
** schemas, including all the same indices, then a special optimization
** is invoked that copies raw records from <table2> over to <table1>.
** See the xferOptimization() function for the implementation of this
** template.  This is the second template.
**
**         open a write cursor to <table>
**         open read cursor on <table2>
**         transfer all records in <table2> over to <table>
**         close cursors
**         foreach index on <table>
**           open a write cursor on the <table> index
**           open a read cursor on the corresponding <table2> index
**           transfer all records from the read to the write cursors
**           close cursors
**         end foreach
**
** The third template is for when the second template does not apply
** and the SELECT clause does not read from <table> at any time.
** The generated code follows this template:
**
**         goto B
**      A: setup for the SELECT
**         loop over the rows in the SELECT
**           gosub C
**         end loop
**         cleanup after the SELECT
**         goto D
**      B: open write cursor to <table> and its indices
**         goto A
**      C: insert the select result into <table>
**         return
**      D: cleanup
**
** The fourth template is used if the insert statement takes its
** values from a SELECT but the data is being inserted into a table
** that is also read as part of the SELECT.  In the third form,
** we have to use a intermediate table to store the results of
** the select.  The template is like this:
**
**         goto B
**      A: setup for the SELECT
**         loop over the tables in the SELECT
**           gosub C
**         end loop
**         cleanup after the SELECT
**         goto D
**      C: insert the select result into the intermediate table
**         return
**      B: open a cursor to an intermediate table
**         goto A
**      D: open write cursor to <table> and its indices
**         loop over the intermediate table
**           transfer values form intermediate table into <table>
**         end the loop
**         cleanup

** Generate code to do constraint checks prior to an INSERT or an UPDATE.

** The input is a range of consecutive registers as follows:

**    1.  The rowid of the row to be updated before the update.  This
**        value is omitted unless we are doing an UPDATE that involves a
**        change to the record number or writing to a virtual table.
**
**    2.  The rowid of the row after the update.
**
**    3.  The data in the first column of the entry after the update.
**
**    i.  Data from middle columns...
**
**    N.  The data in the last column of the entry after the update.
**
** The regRowid parameter is the index of the register containing (2).
**
** The old rowid shown as entry (1) above is omitted unless both isUpdate
** and rowidChng are 1.  isUpdate is true for UPDATEs and false for
** INSERTs.  RowidChng means that the new rowid is explicitly specified by
** the update or insert statement.  If rowidChng is false, it means that
** the rowid is computed automatically in an insert or that the rowid value
** is not modified by the update.
**
** The code generated by this routine store new index entries into
** registers identified by aRegIdx[].  No index entry is created for
** indices where aRegIdx[i]==0.  The order of indices in aRegIdx[] is
** the same as the order of indices on the linked list of indices
** attached to the table.
**
** This routine also generates code to check constraints.  NOT NULL,
** CHECK, and UNIQUE constraints are all checked.  If a constraint fails,
** then the appropriate action is performed.  There are five possible
** actions: ROLLBACK, ABORT, FAIL, REPLACE, and IGNORE.
**
**  Constraint type  Action       What Happens
**  ---------------  ----------   ----------------------------------------
**  any              ROLLBACK     The current transaction is rolled back and
**                                sqlite3_exec() returns immediately with a
**                                return code of SQLITE_CONSTRAINT.
**
**  any              ABORT        Back out changes from the current command
**                                only (do not do a complete rollback) then
**                                cause sqlite3_exec() to return immediately
**                                with SQLITE_CONSTRAINT.
**
**  any              FAIL         Sqlite_exec() returns immediately with a
**                                return code of SQLITE_CONSTRAINT.  The
**                                transaction is not rolled back and any
**                                prior changes are retained.
**
**  any              IGNORE       The record number and data is popped from
**                                the stack and there is an immediate jump
**                                to label ignoreDest.
**
**  NOT NULL         REPLACE      The NULL value is replace by the default
**                                value for that column.  If the default value
**                                is NULL, the action is the same as ABORT.
**
**  UNIQUE           REPLACE      The other row that conflicts with the row
**                                being inserted is removed.
**
**  CHECK            REPLACE      Illegal.  The results in an exception.
**
** Which action to take is determined by the overrideError parameter.
** Or if overrideError==OE_Default, then the pParse->onError parameter
** is used.  Or if pParse->onError==OE_Default then the onError value
** for the constraint is used.
**
** The calling routine must open a read/write cursor for pTab with
** cursor number "baseCur".  All indices of pTab must also have open
** read/write cursors with cursor number baseCur+i for the i-th cursor.
** Except, if there is no possibility of a REPLACE action then
** cursors do not need to be open for indices where aRegIdx[i]==0.

** This routine is called to process a query that is really the union
** or intersection of two or more separate queries.
**
** "p" points to the right-most of the two queries.  the query on the
** left is p->pPrior.  The left query could also be a compound query
** in which case this routine will be called recursively. 
**
** The results of the total query are to be written into a destination
** of type eDest with parameter iParm.
**
** Example 1:  Consider a three-way compound SQL statement.
**
**     SELECT a FROM t1 UNION SELECT b FROM t2 UNION SELECT c FROM t3
**
** This statement is parsed up as follows:
**
**     SELECT c FROM t3
**      |
**      `----->  SELECT b FROM t2
**                |
**                `------>  SELECT a FROM t1
**
** The arrows in the diagram above represent the Select.pPrior pointer.
** So if this routine is called with p equal to the t3 query, then
** pPrior will be the t2 query.  p->op will be TK_UNION in this case.
**
** Notice that because of the way SQLite parses compound SELECTs, the
** individual selects always group from left to right.

/*
** This routine attempts to flatten subqueries in order to speed
** execution.  It returns 1 if it makes changes and 0 if no flattening
** occurs.
**
** To understand the concept of flattening, consider the following
** query:
**
**     SELECT a FROM (SELECT x+y AS a FROM t1 WHERE z<100) WHERE a>5
**
** The default way of implementing this query is to execute the
** subquery first and store the results in a temporary table, then
** run the outer query on that temporary table.  This requires two
** passes over the data.  Furthermore, because the temporary table
** has no indices, the WHERE clause on the outer query cannot be
** optimized.
**
** This routine attempts to rewrite queries such as the above into
** a single flat select, like this:
**
**     SELECT x+y AS a FROM t1 WHERE z<100 AND a>5
**
** The code generated for this simpification gives the same result
** but only has to scan the data once.  And because indices might 
** exist on the table t1, a complete scan of the data might be
** avoided.
**
** Flattening is only attempted if all of the following are true:
**
**   (1)  The subquery and the outer query do not both use aggregates.
**
**   (2)  The subquery is not an aggregate or the outer query is not a join.
**
**   (3)  The subquery is not the right operand of a left outer join, or
**        the subquery is not itself a join.  (Ticket #306)
**
**   (4)  The subquery is not DISTINCT or the outer query is not a join.
**
**   (5)  The subquery is not DISTINCT or the outer query does not use
**        aggregates.
**
**   (6)  The subquery does not use aggregates or the outer query is not
**        DISTINCT.
**
**   (7)  The subquery has a FROM clause.
**
**   (8)  The subquery does not use LIMIT or the outer query is not a join.
**
**   (9)  The subquery does not use LIMIT or the outer query does not use
**        aggregates.
**
**  (10)  The subquery does not use aggregates or the outer query does not
**        use LIMIT.
**
**  (11)  The subquery and the outer query do not both have ORDER BY clauses.
**
**  (12)  The subquery is not the right term of a LEFT OUTER JOIN or the
**        subquery has no WHERE clause.  (added by ticket #350)
**
**  (13)  The subquery and outer query do not both use LIMIT
**
**  (14)  The subquery does not use OFFSET
**
**  (15)  The outer query is not part of a compound select or the
**        subquery does not have both an ORDER BY and a LIMIT clause.
**        (See ticket #2339)
**
**  (16)  The outer query is not an aggregate or the subquery does
**        not contain ORDER BY.  (Ticket #2942)  This used to not matter
**        until we introduced the group_concat() function.  
**
** In this routine, the "p" parameter is a pointer to the outer query.
** The subquery is p->pSrc->a[iFrom].  isAgg is true if the outer query
** uses aggregates and subqueryIsAgg is true if the subquery uses aggregates.
**
** If flattening is not attempted, this routine is a no-op and returns 0.
** If flattening is attempted this routine returns 1.
**
** All of the expression analysis must occur on both the outer query and
** the subquery before this routine runs.

** as follows:
**
**     pDest->eDest    Result
**     ------------    -------------------------------------------
**     SRT_Callback    Invoke the callback for each row of the result.
**
**     SRT_Mem         Store first result in memory cell pDest->iParm
**
**     SRT_Set         Store non-null results as keys of table pDest->iParm. 
**                     Apply the affinity pDest->affinity before storing them.
**
**     SRT_Union       Store results as a key in a temporary table pDest->iParm.
**
**     SRT_Except      Remove results from the temporary table pDest->iParm.
**
**     SRT_Table       Store results in temporary table pDest->iParm
**
**     SRT_EphemTab    Create an temporary table pDest->iParm and store
**                     the result there. The cursor is left open after
**                     returning.
**
**     SRT_Subroutine  For each row returned, push the results onto the
**                     vdbe stack and call the subroutine (via OP_Gosub)
**                     at address pDest->iParm.
**
**     SRT_Exists      Store a 1 in memory cell pDest->iParm if the result
**                     set is not empty.
**
**     SRT_Discard     Throw the results away.
**
** See the selectInnerLoop() function for a canonical listing of the 
** allowed values of eDest and their meanings.
**
** This routine returns the number of errors.  If any errors are
** encountered, then an appropriate error message is left in
** pParse->zErrMsg.
**
** This routine does NOT free the Select structure passed in.  The
** calling function needs to do that.
**
** The pParent, parentTab, and *pParentAgg fields are filled in if this
** SELECT is a subquery.  This routine may try to combine this SELECT
** with its parent to form a single flat query.  In so doing, it might
** change the parent query from a non-aggregate to an aggregate query.
** For that reason, the pParentAgg flag is passed as a pointer, so it
** can be changed.
**
** Example 1:   The meaning of the pParent parameter.
**
**    SELECT * FROM t1 JOIN (SELECT x, count(*) FROM t2) JOIN t3;
**    \                      \_______ subquery _______/        /
**     \                                                      /
**      \____________________ outer query ___________________/
**
** This routine is called for the outer query first.   For that call,
** pParent will be NULL.  During the processing of the outer query, this 
** routine is called recursively to handle the subquery.  For the recursive
** call, pParent will point to the outer query.  Because the subquery is
** the second element in a three-way join, the parentTab parameter will
** be 1 (the 2nd value of a 0-indexed array.)

** The most recently coded instruction was an OP_Column to retrieve the

**
** The default value of a column is specified by a DEFAULT clause in the 
** column definition. This was either supplied by the user when the table
** was created, or added later to the table definition by an ALTER TABLE
** command. If the latter, then the row-records in the table btree on disk
** may not contain a value for the column and the default value, taken
** from the P4 parameter of the OP_Column instruction, is returned instead.
** If the former, then all row-records are guaranteed to include a value
** for the column and the P4 value is not required.
**
** Column definitions created by an ALTER TABLE command may only have 
** literal default values specified: a number, null or a string. (If a more
** complicated default expression value was provided, it is evaluated 
** when the ALTER TABLE is executed and one of the literal values written
** into the sqlite_master table.)
**
** Therefore, the P4 parameter is only required if the default value for
** the column is a literal number, string or null. The sqlite3ValueFromExpr()
** function is capable of transforming these types of expressions into

** Generate the beginning of the loop used for WHERE clause processing.
** The return value is a pointer to an opaque structure that contains
** information needed to terminate the loop.  Later, the calling routine
** should invoke sqlite3WhereEnd() with the return value of this function
** in order to complete the WHERE clause processing.
**
** If an error occurs, this routine returns NULL.
**
** The basic idea is to do a nested loop, one loop for each table in
** the FROM clause of a select.  (INSERT and UPDATE statements are the
** same as a SELECT with only a single table in the FROM clause.)  For
** example, if the SQL is this:
**
**       SELECT * FROM t1, t2, t3 WHERE ...;
**
** Then the code generated is conceptually like the following:
**
**      foreach row1 in t1 do       \    Code generated
**        foreach row2 in t2 do      |-- by sqlite3WhereBegin()
**          foreach row3 in t3 do   /
**            ...
**          end                     \    Code generated
**        end                        |-- by sqlite3WhereEnd()
**      end                         /
**
** Note that the loops might not be nested in the order in which they
** appear in the FROM clause if a different order is better able to make
** use of indices.  Note also that when the IN operator appears in
** the WHERE clause, it might result in additional nested loops for
** scanning through all values on the right-hand side of the IN.
**
** There are Btree cursors associated with each table.  t1 uses cursor
** number pTabList->a[0].iCursor.  t2 uses the cursor pTabList->a[1].iCursor.
** And so forth.  This routine generates code to open those VDBE cursors
** and sqlite3WhereEnd() generates the code to close them.
**
** The code that sqlite3WhereBegin() generates leaves the cursors named
** in pTabList pointing at their appropriate entries.  The [...] code
** can use OP_Column and OP_Rowid opcodes on these cursors to extract
** data from the various tables of the loop.
**
** If the WHERE clause is empty, the foreach loops must each scan their
** entire tables.  Thus a three-way join is an O(N^3) operation.  But if
** the tables have indices and there are terms in the WHERE clause that
** refer to those indices, a complete table scan can be avoided and the
** code will run much faster.  Most of the work of this routine is checking
** to see if there are indices that can be used to speed up the loop.
**
** Terms of the WHERE clause are also used to limit which rows actually
** make it to the "..." in the middle of the loop.  After each "foreach",
** terms of the WHERE clause that use only terms in that loop and outer
** loops are evaluated and if false a jump is made around all subsequent
** inner loops (or around the "..." if the test occurs within the inner-
** most loop)
**
** OUTER JOINS
**
** An outer join of tables t1 and t2 is conceptally coded as follows:
**
**    foreach row1 in t1 do
**      flag = 0
**      foreach row2 in t2 do
**        start:
**          ...
**          flag = 1
**      end
**      if flag==0 then
**        move the row2 cursor to a null row
**        goto start
**      fi
**    end
**
** ORDER BY CLAUSE PROCESSING
**
** *ppOrderBy is a pointer to the ORDER BY clause of a SELECT statement,
** if there is one.  If there is no ORDER BY clause or if this routine
** is called from an UPDATE or DELETE statement, then ppOrderBy is NULL.
**
** If an index can be used so that the natural output order of the table
** scan is correct for the ORDER BY clause, then that index is used and
** *ppOrderBy is set to NULL.  This is an optimization that prevents an
** unnecessary sort of the result set if an index appropriate for the
** ORDER BY clause already exists.
**
** If the where clause loops cannot be arranged to provide the correct
** output order, then the *ppOrderBy is unchanged.

**    YYMINORTYPE        is the data type used for all minor tokens.

**   YYNSTATE <= N < YYNSTATE+YYNRULE   Reduce by rule N-YYNSTATE.
**
**   N == YYNSTATE+YYNRULE              A syntax error has occurred.
**
**   N == YYNSTATE+YYNRULE+1            The parser accepts its input.
**
**   N == YYNSTATE+YYNRULE+2            No such action.  Denotes unused
**                                      slots in the yy_action[] table.
**
** The action table is constructed as a single large table named yy_action[].
** Given state S and lookahead X, the action is computed as
**
**      yy_action[ yy_shift_ofst[S] + X ]
**
** If the index value yy_shift_ofst[S]+X is out of range or if the value
** yy_lookahead[yy_shift_ofst[S]+X] is not equal to X or if yy_shift_ofst[S]
** is equal to YY_SHIFT_USE_DFLT, it means that the action is not in the table
** and that yy_default[S] should be used instead.  
**
** The formula above is for computing the action when the lookahead is
** a terminal symbol.  If the lookahead is a non-terminal (as occurs after
** a reduce action) then the yy_reduce_ofst[] array is used in place of
** the yy_shift_ofst[] array and YY_REDUCE_USE_DFLT is used in place of
** YY_SHIFT_USE_DFLT.
**
** The following are the tables generated in this section:
**
**  yy_action[]        A single table containing all actions.
**  yy_lookahead[]     A table containing the lookahead for each entry in
**                     yy_action.  Used to detect hash collisions.
**  yy_shift_ofst[]    For each state, the offset into yy_action for
**                     shifting terminals.
**  yy_reduce_ofst[]   For each state, the offset into yy_action for
**                     shifting non-terminals after a reduce.
**  yy_default[]       Default action for each state.

** Return TRUE if the given SQL string ends in a semicolon.

** Special handling is require for CREATE TRIGGER statements.
** Whenever the CREATE TRIGGER keywords are seen, the statement
** must end with ";END;".
**
** This implementation uses a state machine with 7 states:
**
**   (0) START     At the beginning or end of an SQL statement.  This routine
**                 returns 1 if it ends in the START state and 0 if it ends
**                 in any other state.
**
**   (1) NORMAL    We are in the middle of statement which ends with a single
**                 semicolon.
**
**   (2) EXPLAIN   The keyword EXPLAIN has been seen at the beginning of 
**                 a statement.
**
**   (3) CREATE    The keyword CREATE has been seen at the beginning of a
**                 statement, possibly preceeded by EXPLAIN and/or followed by
**                 TEMP or TEMPORARY
**
**   (4) TRIGGER   We are in the middle of a trigger definition that must be
**                 ended by a semicolon, the keyword END, and another semicolon.
**
**   (5) SEMI      We've seen the first semicolon in the ";END;" that occurs at
**                 the end of a trigger definition.
**
**   (6) END       We've seen the ";END" of the ";END;" that occurs at the end
**                 of a trigger difinition.
**
** Transitions between states above are determined by tokens extracted
** from the input.  The following tokens are significant:
**
**   (0) tkSEMI      A semicolon.
**   (1) tkWS        Whitespace
**   (2) tkOTHER     Any other SQL token.
**   (3) tkEXPLAIN   The "explain" keyword.
**   (4) tkCREATE    The "create" keyword.
**   (5) tkTEMP      The "temp" or "temporary" keyword.
**   (6) tkTRIGGER   The "trigger" keyword.
**   (7) tkEND       The "end" keyword.
**
** Whitespace never causes a state transition and is always ignored.
**
** If we compile with SQLITE_OMIT_TRIGGER, all of the computation needed
** to recognize the end of a trigger can be omitted.  All we have to do
** is look for a semicolon that is not part of an string or comment.

/* The full-text index is stored in a series of b+tree (-like)
** structures called segments which map terms to doclists.  The
** structures are like b+trees in layout, but are constructed from the
** bottom up in optimal fashion and are not updatable.  Since trees
** are built from the bottom up, things will be described from the
** bottom up.
**
**
**** Varints ****
** The basic unit of encoding is a variable-length integer called a
** varint.  We encode variable-length integers in little-endian order
** using seven bits * per byte as follows:
**
** KEY:
**         A = 0xxxxxxx    7 bits of data and one flag bit
**         B = 1xxxxxxx    7 bits of data and one flag bit
**
**  7 bits - A
** 14 bits - BA
** 21 bits - BBA
** and so on.
**
** This is identical to how sqlite encodes varints (see util.c).
**
**
**** Document lists ****
** A doclist (document list) holds a docid-sorted list of hits for a
** given term.  Doclists hold docids, and can optionally associate
** token positions and offsets with docids.
**
** A DL_POSITIONS_OFFSETS doclist is stored like this:
**
** array {
**   varint docid;
**   array {                (position list for column 0)
**     varint position;     (delta from previous position plus POS_BASE)
**     varint startOffset;  (delta from previous startOffset)
**     varint endOffset;    (delta from startOffset)
**   }
**   array {
**     varint POS_COLUMN;   (marks start of position list for new column)
**     varint column;       (index of new column)
**     array {
**       varint position;   (delta from previous position plus POS_BASE)
**       varint startOffset;(delta from previous startOffset)
**       varint endOffset;  (delta from startOffset)
**     }
**   }
**   varint POS_END;        (marks end of positions for this document.
** }
**
** Here, array { X } means zero or more occurrences of X, adjacent in
** memory.  A "position" is an index of a token in the token stream
** generated by the tokenizer, while an "offset" is a byte offset,
** both based at 0.  Note that POS_END and POS_COLUMN occur in the
** same logical place as the position element, and act as sentinals
** ending a position list array.
**
** A DL_POSITIONS doclist omits the startOffset and endOffset
** information.  A DL_DOCIDS doclist omits both the position and
** offset information, becoming an array of varint-encoded docids.
**
** On-disk data is stored as type DL_DEFAULT, so we don't serialize
** the type.  Due to how deletion is implemented in the segmentation
** system, on-disk doclists MUST store at least positions.
**
**
**** Segment leaf nodes ****
** Segment leaf nodes store terms and doclists, ordered by term.  Leaf
** nodes are written using LeafWriter, and read using LeafReader (to
** iterate through a single leaf node's data) and LeavesReader (to
** iterate through a segment's entire leaf layer).  Leaf nodes have
** the format:
**
** varint iHeight;             (height from leaf level, always 0)
** varint nTerm;               (length of first term)
** char pTerm[nTerm];          (content of first term)
** varint nDoclist;            (length of term's associated doclist)
** char pDoclist[nDoclist];    (content of doclist)
** array {
**                             (further terms are delta-encoded)
**   varint nPrefix;           (length of prefix shared with previous term)
**   varint nSuffix;           (length of unshared suffix)
**   char pTermSuffix[nSuffix];(unshared suffix of next term)
**   varint nDoclist;          (length of term's associated doclist)
**   char pDoclist[nDoclist];  (content of doclist)
** }
**
** Here, array { X } means zero or more occurrences of X, adjacent in
** memory.
**
** Leaf nodes are broken into blocks which are stored contiguously in
** the %_segments table in sorted order.  This means that when the end
** of a node is reached, the next term is in the node with the next
** greater node id.
**
** New data is spilled to a new leaf node when the current node
** exceeds LEAF_MAX bytes (default 2048).  New data which itself is
** larger than STANDALONE_MIN (default 1024) is placed in a standalone
** node (a leaf node with a single term and doclist).  The goal of
** these settings is to pack together groups of small doclists while
** making it efficient to directly access large doclists.  The
** assumption is that large doclists represent terms which are more
** likely to be query targets.
**
** TODO(shess) It may be useful for blocking decisions to be more
** dynamic.  For instance, it may make more sense to have a 2.5k leaf
** node rather than splitting into 2k and .5k nodes.  My intuition is
** that this might extend through 2x or 4x the pagesize.
**
**
**** Segment interior nodes ****
** Segment interior nodes store blockids for subtree nodes and terms
** to describe what data is stored by the each subtree.  Interior
** nodes are written using InteriorWriter, and read using
** InteriorReader.  InteriorWriters are created as needed when
** SegmentWriter creates new leaf nodes, or when an interior node
** itself grows too big and must be split.  The format of interior
** nodes:
**
** varint iHeight;           (height from leaf level, always >0)
** varint iBlockid;          (block id of node's leftmost subtree)
** optional {
**   varint nTerm;           (length of first term)
**   char pTerm[nTerm];      (content of first term)
**   array {
**                                (further terms are delta-encoded)
**     varint nPrefix;            (length of shared prefix with previous term)
**     varint nSuffix;            (length of unshared suffix)
**     char pTermSuffix[nSuffix]; (unshared suffix of next term)
**   }
** }
**
** Here, optional { X } means an optional element, while array { X }
** means zero or more occurrences of X, adjacent in memory.
**
** An interior node encodes n terms separating n+1 subtrees.  The
** subtree blocks are contiguous, so only the first subtree's blockid
** is encoded.  The subtree at iBlockid will contain all terms less
** than the first term encoded (or all terms if no term is encoded).
** Otherwise, for terms greater than or equal to pTerm[i] but less
** than pTerm[i+1], the subtree for that term will be rooted at
** iBlockid+i.  Interior nodes only store enough term data to
** distinguish adjacent children (if the rightmost term of the left
** child is "something", and the leftmost term of the right child is
** "wicked", only "w" is stored).
**
** New data is spilled to a new interior node at the same height when
** the current node exceeds INTERIOR_MAX bytes (default 2048).
** INTERIOR_MIN_TERMS (default 7) keeps large terms from monopolizing
** interior nodes and making the tree too skinny.  The interior nodes
** at a given height are naturally tracked by interior nodes at
** height+1, and so on.
**
**
**** Segment directory ****
** The segment directory in table %_segdir stores meta-information for
** merging and deleting segments, and also the root node of the
** segment's tree.
**
** The root node is the top node of the segment's tree after encoding
** the entire segment, restricted to ROOT_MAX bytes (default 1024).
** This could be either a leaf node or an interior node.  If the top
** node requires more than ROOT_MAX bytes, it is flushed to %_segments
** and a new root interior node is generated (which should always fit
** within ROOT_MAX because it only needs space for 2 varints, the
** height and the blockid of the previous root).
**
** The meta-information in the segment directory is:
**   level               - segment level (see below)
**   idx                 - index within level
**                       - (level,idx uniquely identify a segment)
**   start_block         - first leaf node
**   leaves_end_block    - last leaf node
**   end_block           - last block (including interior nodes)
**   root                - contents of root node
**
** If the root node is a leaf node, then start_block,
** leaves_end_block, and end_block are all 0.
**
**
**** Segment merging ****
** To amortize update costs, segments are groups into levels and
** merged in matches.  Each increase in level represents exponentially
** more documents.
**
** New documents (actually, document updates) are tokenized and
** written individually (using LeafWriter) to a level 0 segment, with
** incrementing idx.  When idx reaches MERGE_COUNT (default 16), all
** level 0 segments are merged into a single level 1 segment.  Level 1
** is populated like level 0, and eventually MERGE_COUNT level 1
** segments are merged to a single level 2 segment (representing
** MERGE_COUNT^2 updates), and so on.
**
** A segment merge traverses all segments at a given level in
** parallel, performing a straightforward sorted merge.  Since segment
** leaf nodes are written in to the %_segments table in order, this
** merge traverses the underlying sqlite disk structures efficiently.
** After the merge, all segment blocks from the merged level are
** deleted.
**
** MERGE_COUNT controls how often we merge segments.  16 seems to be
** somewhat of a sweet spot for insertion performance.  32 and 64 show
** very similar performance numbers to 16 on insertion, though they're
** a tiny bit slower (perhaps due to more overhead in merge-time
** sorting).  8 is about 20% slower than 16, 4 about 50% slower than
** 16, 2 about 66% slower than 16.
**
** At query time, high MERGE_COUNT increases the number of segments
** which need to be scanned and merged.  For instance, with 100k docs
** inserted:
**
**    MERGE_COUNT   segments
**       16           25
**        8           12
**        4           10
**        2            6
**
** This appears to have only a moderate impact on queries for very
** frequent terms (which are somewhat dominated by segment merge
** costs), and infrequent and non-existent terms still seem to be fast
** even with many segments.
**
** TODO(shess) That said, it would be nice to have a better query-side
** argument for MERGE_COUNT of 16.  Also, it is possible/likely that
** optimizations to things like doclist merging will swing the sweet
** spot around.
**
**
**
**** Handling of deletions and updates ****
** Since we're using a segmented structure, with no docid-oriented
** index into the term index, we clearly cannot simply update the term
** index when a document is deleted or updated.  For deletions, we
** write an empty doclist (varint(docid) varint(POS_END)), for updates
** we simply write the new doclist.  Segment merges overwrite older
** data for a particular docid with newer data, so deletes or updates
** will eventually overtake the earlier data and knock it out.  The
** query logic likewise merges doclists so that newer data knocks out
** older data.
**
** TODO(shess) Provide a VACUUM type operation to clear out all
** deletions and duplications.  This would basically be a forced merge
** into a single segment.

/* A query string is parsed into a Query structure.
 *
 * We could, in theory, allow query strings to be complicated
 * nested expressions with precedence determined by parentheses.
 * But none of the major search engines do this.  (Perhaps the
 * feeling is that an parenthesized expression is two complex of
 * an idea for the average user to grasp.)  Taking our lead from
 * the major search engines, we will allow queries to be a list
 * of terms (with an implied AND operator) or phrases in double-quotes,
 * with a single optional "-" before each non-phrase term to designate
 * negation and an optional OR connector.
 *
 * OR binds more tightly than the implied AND, which is what the
 * major search engines seem to do.  So, for example:
 * 
 *    [one two OR three]     ==>    one AND (two OR three)
 *    [one OR two three]     ==>    (one OR two) AND three
 *
 * A "-" before a term matches all entries that lack that term.
 * The "-" must occur immediately before the term with in intervening
 * space.  This is how the search engines do it.
 *
 * A NOT term cannot be the right-hand operand of an OR.  If this
 * occurs in the query string, the NOT is ignored:
 *
 *    [one OR -two]          ==>    one OR two
 *

SNMP Tests
----------

To enable these tests, you must have :
- PHP compiled with SNMP (--with-snmp)
- an SNMP server running.


** How to test **
You need to give credentials with environment vars if default ones are not
sutable (see snmp_include.inc for more info):
SNMP_HOSTNAME : IPv4 of remote SNMP agent
SNMP_HOSTNAME : IPv6 or remote SNMP agent
SNMP_PORT : SNMP port for queries
SNMP_COMMUNITY : community name
SNMP_COMMUNITY_WRITE : community used for write tests (snmpset()).
SNMP_MIBDIR : Directory containing MIBS

To run test suite you may use this command (presuming that you pwd is where
this README file is located):
> make -C ../../.. test TESTS="`cd ../../..; /bin/ls -1 ext/snmp/tests/*.phpt | xargs echo`"
Running run-tests.php directly will clear your environment and therefore
tests will fail if your SNMP configuration does not fit into default values
specified in snmp_include.inc.

** Configuring the SNMPD server **

On Linux/FreeBSD
--------

- Install package net-snmpd (name may differ based on your distribution).
- Replace config file (by default this is /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf on Linux and
  /usr/local/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf on FreeBSD) with snmpd.conf supplied.

Before launching daemon make sure that there is no file /var/net-snmp/snmpd.conf
Delete it if exists. Ingoring to to so will fail SNMPv3 tests.

- Place bigtest.sh near snmpd.conf, tune path to it in snmpd.conf

- Launch snmpd (service snmpd start or /etc/init.d/snmpd start).
  Alternatively you can start snmpd daemon using following command line:
    sudo snmpd -C -c ./snmpd.conf -f -Le


On Windows

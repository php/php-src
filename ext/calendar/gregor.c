 *
 * VALID RANGE
 *
 *     4714 B.C. to at least 10000 A.D.
 *
 *     Although this software can handle dates all the way back to 4714
 *     B.C., such use may not be meaningful.  The Gregorian calendar was
 *     not instituted until October 15, 1582 (or October 5, 1582 in the
 *     Julian calendar).  Some countries did not accept it until much
 *     later.  For example, Britain converted in 1752, The USSR in 1918 and
 *     Greece in 1923.  Most European countries used the Julian calendar
 *     prior to the Gregorian.
 *
 * CALENDAR OVERVIEW
 *
 *     The Gregorian calendar is a modified version of the Julian calendar.
 *     The only difference being the specification of leap years.  The
 *     Julian calendar specifies that every year that is a multiple of 4
 *     will be a leap year.  This leads to a year that is 365.25 days long,
 *     but the current accepted value for the tropical year is 365.242199
 *     days.
 *
 *     To correct this error in the length of the year and to bring the
 *     vernal equinox back to March 21, Pope Gregory XIII issued a papal
 *     bull declaring that Thursday October 4, 1582 would be followed by
 *     Friday October 15, 1582 and that centennial years would only be a
 *     leap year if they were a multiple of 400.  This shortened the year
 *     by 3 days per 400 years, giving a year of 365.2425 days.
 *
 *     Another recently proposed change in the leap year rule is to make
 *     years that are multiples of 4000 not a leap year, but this has never
 *     been officially accepted and this rule is not implemented in these
 *     algorithms.
 *
 * ALGORITHMS
 *
 *     The calculations are based on three different cycles: a 400 year
 *     cycle of leap years, a 4 year cycle of leap years and a 5 month
 *     cycle of month lengths.
 *
 *     The 5 month cycle is used to account for the varying lengths of
 *     months.  You will notice that the lengths alternate between 30
 *     and 31 days, except for three anomalies: both July and August
 *     have 31 days, both December and January have 31, and February
 *     is less than 30.  Starting with March, the lengths are in a
 *     cycle of 5 months (31, 30, 31, 30, 31):
 *
 *         Mar   31 days  \
 *         Apr   30 days   |
 *         May   31 days    > First cycle
 *         Jun   30 days   |
 *         Jul   31 days  /
 *
 *         Aug   31 days  \
 *         Sep   30 days   |
 *         Oct   31 days    > Second cycle
 *         Nov   30 days   |
 *         Dec   31 days  /
 *
 *         Jan   31 days  \
 *         Feb 28/9 days   |
 *                          > Third cycle (incomplete)
 *
 *     For this reason the calculations (internally) assume that the
 *     year starts with March 1.
 *
 * TESTING
 *
 *     This algorithm has been tested from the year 4714 B.C. to 10000
 *     A.D.  The source code of the verification program is included in
 *     this package.

 *
 * Convert a Julian calendar date to a SDN.  Zero is returned when the
 * input date is detected as invalid or out of the supported range.  The
 * return value will be > 0 for all valid, supported dates, but there are
 * some invalid dates that will return a positive value.  To verify that a
 * date is valid, convert it to SDN and then back and compare with the

 *
 * VALID RANGE
 *
 *     4713 B.C. to at least 10000 A.D.
 *
 *     Although this software can handle dates all the way back to 4713
 *     B.C., such use may not be meaningful.  The calendar was created in
 *     46 B.C., but the details did not stabilize until at least 8 A.D.,
 *     and perhaps as late at the 4th century.  Also, the beginning of a
 *     year varied from one culture to another - not all accepted January
 *     as the first month.
 *
 * CALENDAR OVERVIEW
 *
 *     Julius Caesar created the calendar in 46 B.C. as a modified form of
 *     the old Roman republican calendar which was based on lunar cycles.
 *     The new Julian calendar set fixed lengths for the months, abandoning
 *     the lunar cycle.  It also specified that there would be exactly 12
 *     months per year and 365.25 days per year with every 4th year being a
 *     leap year.
 *
 *     Note that the current accepted value for the tropical year is
 *     365.242199 days, not 365.25.  This lead to an 11 day shift in the
 *     calendar with respect to the seasons by the 16th century when the
 *     Gregorian calendar was created to replace the Julian calendar.
 *
 *     The difference between the Julian and today's Gregorian calendar is
 *     that the Gregorian does not make centennial years leap years unless
 *     they are a multiple of 400, which leads to a year of 365.2425 days.
 *     In other words, in the Gregorian calendar, 1700, 1800 and 1900 are
 *     not leap years, but 2000 is.  All centennial years are leap years in
 *     the Julian calendar.
 *
 *     The details are unknown, but the lengths of the months were adjusted
 *     until they finally stablized in 8 A.D. with their current lengths:
 *
 *         January          31
 *         February         28/29
 *         March            31
 *         April            30
 *         May              31
 *         June             30
 *         Quintilis/July   31
 *         Sextilis/August  31
 *         September        30
 *         October          31
 *         November         30
 *         December         31
 *
 *     In the early days of the calendar, the days of the month were not
 *     numbered as we do today.  The numbers ran backwards (decreasing) and
 *     were counted from the Ides (15th of the month - which in the old
 *     Roman republican lunar calendar would have been the full moon) or
 *     from the Nonae (9th day before the Ides) or from the beginning of
 *     the next month.
 *
 *     In the early years, the beginning of the year varied, sometimes
 *     based on the ascension of rulers.  It was not always the first of
 *     January.
 *
 *     Also, today's epoch, 1 A.D. or the birth of Jesus Christ, did not
 *     come into use until several centuries later when Christianity became
 *     a dominant religion.
 *
 * ALGORITHMS
 *
 *     The calculations are based on two different cycles: a 4 year cycle
 *     of leap years and a 5 month cycle of month lengths.
 *
 *     The 5 month cycle is used to account for the varying lengths of
 *     months.  You will notice that the lengths alternate between 30 and
 *     31 days, except for three anomalies: both July and August have 31
 *     days, both December and January have 31, and February is less than
 *     30.  Starting with March, the lengths are in a cycle of 5 months
 *     (31, 30, 31, 30, 31):
 *
 *         Mar   31 days  \
 *         Apr   30 days   |
 *         May   31 days    > First cycle
 *         Jun   30 days   |
 *         Jul   31 days  /
 *
 *         Aug   31 days  \
 *         Sep   30 days   |
 *         Oct   31 days    > Second cycle
 *         Nov   30 days   |
 *         Dec   31 days  /
 *
 *         Jan   31 days  \
 *         Feb 28/9 days   |
 *                          > Third cycle (incomplete)
 *
 *     For this reason the calculations (internally) assume that the year
 *     starts with March 1.
 *
 * TESTING
 *
 *     This algorithm has been tested from the year 4713 B.C. to 10000 A.D.
 *     The source code of the verification program is included in this
 *     package.

Test scripts assumes:
 - PostgreSQL server is installed locally
 - there is a PostgreSQL account for the users running the test scripts
 - there is database named "test"

For instance, if your login name is 'testuser', you should have PostgreSQL
user account named 'testuser' and grant that user access to the database
'test'.

If you have account and database, type "createdb test" from command prompt
to create the database to execute the test scripts. By executing the above
command as the same user running the tests you ensure that the user is
granted access to the database.

If you find problems in PostgreSQL module, please mail to
intenals@lists.php.net, helly@php.net or yohgaki@php.net.

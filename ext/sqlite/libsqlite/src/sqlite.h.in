/*
** A function to executes one or more statements of SQL.
**
** If one or more of the SQL statements are queries, then

** invoked once for each row of the query result.  This callback
** should normally return 0.  If the callback returns a non-zero
** value then the query is aborted, all subsequent SQL statements
** are skipped and the sqlite_exec() function returns the SQLITE_ABORT.
**
** The 4th parameter is an arbitrary pointer that is passed
** to the callback function as its first parameter.
**
** The 2nd parameter to the callback function is the number of
** columns in the query result.  The 3rd parameter to the callback
** is an array of strings holding the values for each column.
** The 4th parameter to the callback is an array of strings holding
** the names of each column.
**
** The callback function may be NULL, even for queries.  A NULL
** callback is not an error.  It just means that no callback
** will be invoked.
**
** If an error occurs while parsing or evaluating the SQL (but
** not while executing the callback) then an appropriate error
** message is written into memory obtained from malloc() and
** *errmsg is made to point to that message.  The calling function
** is responsible for freeing the memory that holds the error
** message.   Use sqlite_freemem() for this.  If errmsg==NULL,
** then no error message is ever written.
**
** The return value is is SQLITE_OK if there are no errors and
** some other return code if there is an error.  The particular
** return value depends on the type of error. 
**
** If the query could not be executed because a database file is
** locked or busy, then this function returns SQLITE_BUSY.  (This
** behavior can be modified somewhat using the sqlite_busy_handler()
** and sqlite_busy_timeout() functions below.)

/*
** This next routine is really just a wrapper around sqlite_exec().
** Instead of invoking a user-supplied callback for each row of the
** result, this routine remembers each row of the result in memory
** obtained from malloc(), then returns all of the result after the
** query has finished. 
**
** As an example, suppose the query result where this table:
**
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
**
** If the 3rd argument were &azResult then after the function returns
** azResult will contain the following data:
**
**        azResult[0] = "Name";
**        azResult[1] = "Age";
**        azResult[2] = "Alice";
**        azResult[3] = "43";
**        azResult[4] = "Bob";
**        azResult[5] = "28";
**        azResult[6] = "Cindy";
**        azResult[7] = "21";
**
** Notice that there is an extra row of data containing the column
** headers.  But the *nrow return value is still 3.  *ncolumn is
** set to 2.  In general, the number of values inserted into azResult
** will be ((*nrow) + 1)*(*ncolumn).
**
** After the calling function has finished using the result, it should 
** pass the result data pointer to sqlite_free_table() in order to 
** release the memory that was malloc-ed.  Because of the way the 
** malloc() happens, the calling function must not try to call 
** malloc() directly.  Only sqlite_free_table() is able to release 
** the memory properly and safely.
**
** The return value of this routine is the same as from sqlite_exec().

** The following routines are wrappers around sqlite_exec() and
** sqlite_get_table().  The only difference between the routines that
** follow and the originals is that the second argument to the 
** routines that follow is really a printf()-style format
** string describing the SQL to be executed.  Arguments to the format
** string appear at the end of the argument list.
**
** All of the usual printf formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is a "%q" option.  %q works like %s in that it substitutes a null-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, so some string variable contains text as follows:
**
**      char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
**
** We can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
**      sqlite_exec_printf(db, "INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')",
**          callback1, 0, 0, zText);
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
**      INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
**      INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
**
** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you
** should always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string 
** literal.

** virtual machine.  *pN is set to 0 and *pazColName and *pazValue are set
** to NULL.  Use sqlite_finalize() to obtain the specific error code
** and the error message text for the error.
**
** SQLITE_BUSY means that an attempt to open the database failed because
** another thread or process is holding a lock.  The calling routine
** can try again to open the database by calling sqlite_step() again.
** The return code will only be SQLITE_BUSY if no busy handler is registered
** using the sqlite_busy_handler() or sqlite_busy_timeout() routines.  If

** SQLITE_BUSY when it is called.
**

** (*azValue)[i].  *pN and *pazColName are set as described in SQLITE_DONE.

** has halted (after a prior call to sqlite_step() has returned SQLITE_DONE)

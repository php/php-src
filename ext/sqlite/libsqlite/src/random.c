** Why not just use a library random generator like lrand48() for this?
** Because the OP_NewRecno opcode in the VDBE depends on having a very
** good source of random numbers.  The lrand48() library function may
** well be good enough.  But maybe not.  Or maybe lrand48() has some
** subtle problems on some systems that could cause problems.  It is hard

** implementations, SQLite uses this random number generator based
** on RC4, which we know works very well.

 * XXX - how should we distinguish Java from C++?
 * The trick used in a Debian snapshot, of having "extends" or "implements"
 * as tags for Java, doesn't work very well, given that those keywords
 * are often preceded by "class", which flags it as C++.
 *
 * Perhaps we need to be able to say
 *
 *	If "class" then
 *
 *		if "extends" or "implements" then
 *			Java
 *		else
 *			C++
 *	endif
 *
 * Or should we use other keywords, such as "package" or "import"?
 * Unfortunately, Ada95 uses "package", and Modula-3 uses "import",
 * although I infer from the language spec at
 *
 *	http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/m3defn/html/m3.html
 *
 * that Modula-3 uses "IMPORT" rather than "import", i.e. it must be
 * in all caps.
 *
 * So, for now, we go with "import".  We must put it before the C++
 * stuff, so that we don't misidentify Java as C++.  Not using "package"
 * means we won't identify stuff that defines a package but imports
 * nothing; hopefully, very little Java code imports nothing (one of the
 * reasons for doing OO programming is to import as much as possible
 * and write only what you need to, right?).
 *
 * Unfortunately, "import" may cause us to misidentify English text
 * as Java, as it comes after "the" and "The".  Perhaps we need a fancier
 * heuristic to identify Java?

This is msession, it is an interface to a stand-alone session
management system. The msession daemon can be found at 
Mohawk Software's web site.

Requirements:
Mohawk Software's Phoenix library.
Mohawk Software's msession daemon.

Building:
In the config.m4 file you will need to specify the include 
and library directories for Phoenix. The setting in config.m4
is probably wrong.

You will need phoenix installed and built to compile this
module.

To use msession-test.php, msession must be the default session
handler in PHP. The easiest way to do that is in the php.ini
file as:

[Session]
session.save_handler = msession
session.save_path = localhost

The session.save.path is the host name of the server running
msessiond.

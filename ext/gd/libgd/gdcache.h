/*
 * gdcache.h
 *
 * Caches of pointers to user structs in which the least-recently-used
 * element is replaced in the event of a cache miss after the cache has
 * reached a given size.
 *
 * John Ellson  (ellson@graphviz.org)  Oct 31, 1997
 *
 * Test this with:
 *		 gcc -o gdcache -g -Wall -DTEST gdcache.c
 *
 * The cache is implemented by a singly-linked list of elements
 * each containing a pointer to a user struct that is being managed by
 * the cache.
 *
 * The head structure has a pointer to the most-recently-used
 * element, and elements are moved to this position in the list each
 * time they are used.  The head also contains pointers to three
 * user defined functions:
 *		- a function to test if a cached userdata matches some keydata
 *		- a function to provide a new userdata struct to the cache
 *          if there has been a cache miss.
 *		- a function to release a userdata struct when it is
 *          no longer being managed by the cache
 *
 * In the event of a cache miss the cache is allowed to grow up to
 * a specified maximum size.  After the maximum size is reached then
 * the least-recently-used element is discarded to make room for the
 * new.  The most-recently-returned value is always left at the
 * beginning of the list after retrieval.
 *
 * In the current implementation the cache is traversed by a linear
 * search from most-recent to least-recent.  This linear search
 * probably limits the usefulness of this implementation to cache
 * sizes of a few tens of elements.

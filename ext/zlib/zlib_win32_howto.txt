Rules for building ZLIB
-----------------------

The zlib project requires the following files:

php_build\zlib\include\zlib.h
php_build\zlib\include\zconf.h
php_build\zlib\lib\zlibstat.lib

php_build is a directory at the same level as php7.

Start Visual Studio, load php_modules.dsw, select the ZLIB projects, and build
it.

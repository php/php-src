mnoGoSearch extension module for PHP4.

For details please refer to http://www.mnogosearch.org/

If used with mysql you should not use bundled mysql library 
in the php distribution. You should use native mysql 
library. To do this you should compile php with specefying mysql-dir
(for example --with-mysql=/usr, not --with-mysql).

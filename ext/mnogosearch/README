mnoGoSearch extension module for PHP.

For details please refer to http://www.mnogosearch.org/

If used with mysql you should not use bundled mysql library 
in the php distribution. You should use native mysql 
library. To do this you should compile php with specefying mysql-dir
(for example --with-mysql=/usr, not --with-mysql).

To compile PHP with CVS versions of mnogosearch (not with official releases)
you must open configure script of mnogosearch in your editor. Find
line like the following:

VERSION=x.x.x-`date "+%d%m%Y"`

where x.x.x is the mnogosearch version number like 3.2.16 or so.
Then just remove -`date "+%d%m%Y"`. After that this line should be
VERSION=x.x.x

After complete you should reconfigure, recompile, reinstall mnogosearch and
php.

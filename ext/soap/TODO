General
-------
- rename soapobject to soapclient
- make sure soapvar and soapparam are really need
- make sure soapserver.map(), soap_encode_to_xml() and soap_encode_to_zval() are really need
- reimplement SoapObject::__getfunctions() and SoapObject::__gettypes()
  to return structures instead of strings
- memory leaks (libxml and WSDL/Schema use malloc to cache WSDL)


SOAP
----
- SOAP message MUST NOT contain Processing Instructions <?xml-stylesheet ... ?> (XML_PI_NODE)
- support for SOAP headers
  - actor attribute
  - mustUnderstend attribute
- root attribute
- make sure soap 1.1 and 1.2 are supported fully

Encoding
--------
? full support for standard simple types (
  ? language, (pattern: "[a-zA-Z]{1,8}(-[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,8})*")
  ? NMTOKEN, (pattern: "\c+") (\c: [a-zA-Z0-9.\-_:])
  ? NMTOKENS, (list: NMTOKEN, minLength: 1)
  ? Name, (pattern: "\i\c*") (\i: [a-zA-Z_:]
  ? NCName, (pattern: "[\i-[:]][\c-[:]]*")
  ? ID, (base: NCName)
  ? IDREF, (base: NCName)
  ? IDREFS, (list: IDREF; minLength: 1) 
  ? ENTITY, (base: NCName)
  ? ENTITIES,  (list: ENTITY; minLength: 1) 
  ? duration)
? full support for standard date/time types (
  ? dateTime,
  ? time,
  ? date,
  ? gYearMonth,
  ? gYear,
  ? gMonthDay,
  ? gDay,
  ? gMonth)
? proper encoding of standard hexBinary type
? proper encoding of standard base64Binary type
? full support for arrays
  - SOAP 1.1 encoding of arrays with holes (partially transmitted and sparse arrays)
	  SOAP 1.2 doesn't support partially transmitted and sparse arrays
- references to external resources
? support for "nillable" and "nil"
- default values of <element>
? provide schema 1999/2001 support???
? make internal refrences for soap encoding (use seralization logic)???
? provide user space overriding of serialization certin objects and types???

WSDL
----
- support for portType operation parameterOrder attribute
- support for binding operation input/output name attribute (part of overloading)
- support for <opperation> <fault>
- support for style "rpc"/"document" encoding (server part)
  How to get function name from request? May be SoapAction HTTP header?
- function/method overloading/redeclaration (test(int); test(string))
- wsdl caching
- wsdl auto generation
? SOAP binding
  - <soap:body> parts attribute
  - <soap:fault>
  - <soap:header> and <soap:headerfault>
- HTTP GET/POST binding
- MIME binding
- SOAP 1.2 bindings???

Schema
------
- <redefine>
? support for user defined simple types
  ? restiction
	  ? enumeration
		? length (for string, anyURI, hexBinary, base64Binary and derived) list???
		? minLength (for string, hexBinary, base64Binary and derived) list???
		? maxLength (for string, hexBinary, base64Binary and derived) list???
		+ whiteSpace (preserve, replace [#x9,#xA,#xD=>#x20], collapse [replace+?])
		- pattern
	  - minExclusive (for numeric, date types)
		- minInclusive (for numeric, date types)
		- maxExclusive (for numeric, date types)
		- maxInclusive (for numeric, date types)
		- totalDigits (for decimal)
		- fractionDigits (for decimal)
	? union
? support for user defined complex types
  ? full support for content model encoding/decoding

Error Handling
--------------
- ???

Transport
---------
? HTTP status codes
? HTTP chunked Transfer-Encoding
- support for HTTP compression (gzip,x-gzip,defalte)
- support for HTTP proxies
- transport abstraction layer???

UDDI
----
- ???

Interop Testing
---------------
- more rounds/groups
- ???

 --CREDIT--
############

The ``--CREDIT--`` section is a legacy section and should not be used for new tests.

It used to be used to credit contributors without CVS/SVN commit rights, who put their name and
email on the first line.

If the test was part of a TestFest event, then ``#`` followed by the name of the event and the date
(``YYYY-MM-DD``) on the second line.

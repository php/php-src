 Running the test suite
########################

php-src has a custom test runner that is the ``run-tests.php`` file at the root of the repository.

There are two ways of executing the test runner, either via the makefile, or by invoking the test
runner directly.

******************
 Via the makefile
******************

After having compiled PHP a prompt to execute ``make test`` appears, doing so will run all the tests
(a bit less than 18 000 at the time of writing) with a single thread. This is slow, but there are
various ways to speed this up!

First of all it is possible to set a ``TEST_PHP_ARGS`` variable with the make command that will pass
the defined arguments to the test runner. One important argument is the ``-jN`` argument which
allows the tests to be run in parallel (if possible). Some other important arguments are ``-q``,
which makes the test runner silent (i.e. stops prompting to send the test results via email), and
the ``--asan`` argument which is required when running tests with a build of PHP compiled with ASAN.

Secondly, one can reduce the number of tests being run by specifying which individual tests, or test
folders should be run via the ``TESTS`` variable.

 Test runner options
*********************

The test runner accepts various options that can be discovered by invoking it with ``--help`` Here
is a list of the most common and useful options:

-  ``-g``: to filter which tests are shown, e.g. ``-g FAIL`` to only show failing tests
-  ``-x``: to skip tests marked as slow
-  ``--offline``: to skip tests which require an internet connection
-  ``-d``: to set an INI option, useful to enable/disable opcache and the JIT, e.g. ``-d
   opcache.enable=0``

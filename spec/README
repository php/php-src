= RubySpec

RubySpec (http://rubyspec.org) provides the annotation of the Ruby
implementation in an executable format.  The make task
`update-rubyspec' retrieves the specification and puts it into this
directory.

== Directory structure

  +-- mspec            driver library for executing the specification.
  +-- rubyspec
       +-- core        specification for core libraries
       |    +-- array
       |    +-- bignum
       |    +-- ...
       |
       +-- fixtures    example classes for writing specs
       +-- language    specification for Ruby language itself
       +-- library     specification for standard libraries
            +-- addrev

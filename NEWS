  {PREFIX}/bin/php. If you don't disable the CGI binary, it will be
  installed as {PREFIX}/bin/php-cgi.
- Removed extensions: (Jan, Jani)
  . ext/aspell
  . ext/ccvs
  . ext/cybercash
  . ext/icap
  . sapi/fhttpd

- Fixed a bug in socket_select() that could cause unexpected behavior when
  using a statement like $w = $e = array($sock); This change unfortunately
  prevents the use of constant values (e.g. NULL) for the socket array

  leftmost member being a temporary variable. ex.:
  socket_select($w, $r, $e = NULL, 10); (Jason)

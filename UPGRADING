========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- Core:
  By fixing bug #66015 it is no longer possible to overwrite keys in static scalar
  arrays. Quick example to illustrate:
  class Test {
       const FIRST = 1;
       public $array = array(
           self::FIRST => 'first',
           'second',
           'third'
       );
  }
  Test::$array will have as expected three array keys (1, 2, 3) and no longer
  two (0, 1). self::FIRST will no longer overwrite 'third' having key 1 then,
  but will mark the beginning of indexing. 

- JSON:
  json_decode() no longer accepts non-lowercase variants of lone JSON true,
  false or null values. For example, True or FALSE will now cause json_decode to
  return NULL and set an error value you can fetch with json_last_error().
  This affects JSON texts consisting solely of true, false or null. Text
  containing non-lowercase values inside JSON arrays or objects has never been
  accepted.

- OpenSSL:
  To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks against encrypted transfers client
  streams now verify peer certificates by default. Previous versions
  required users to manually enable peer verification. As a result of this
  change, existing code using ssl:// or tls:// stream wrappers (e.g.
  file_get_contents(), fsockopen(), stream_socket_client()) may no longer
  connect successfully without manually disabling peer verification via the
  stream context's "verify_peer" setting. Encrypted transfers delegate to
  operating system certificate stores by default if not overridden via the
  new openssl.cafile and openssl.cafile ini directives or via call-time SSL
  context options, so most users should be unaffected by this transparent
  security enhancement. (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/tls-peer-verification)

- Mcrypt:
  The mcrypt_encrypt(), mcrypt_decrypt() and mcrypt_{MODE}() functions no
  longer accept keys or IVs with incorrect sizes. Furthermore an IV is now
  required if the used block cipher mode requires it.

- cURL:
  Uploads using the @file syntax are now unsupported by default.

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- Added constant scalar expressions syntax.
  (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/const_scalar_exprs)

- Added dedicated syntax for variadic functions.
  (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/variadics)

- Added support for argument unpacking to complement the variadic syntax.
  (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/argument_unpacking)

- Added an exponentiation operator (**).
  (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pow-operator)

- Added unified default encoding. default_charset=UTF-8 and functions/extensions
  use encoding settings honor default_charset.

- The php://input stream is now re-usable and can be used concurrently with
  enable_post_data_reading=0.

- Added use function and use const.
  (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/use_function)

- Added a function for timing attack safe string comparison
  (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/timing_attack)

- Added the __debugInfo() magic method to allow userland classes to implement
  the get_debug_info API previously available only to extensions.
  (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/debug-info)

- Added gost-crypto (CryptoPro S-box) hash algorithm.

- Stream wrappers verify peer certificates and host names by default in
  encrypted client streams.

- Added openssl certificate fingerprint support (inclusive stream context
  option).

- Added support for SAN x509 extension matching when verifing host names in
  encrypted streams.

- Added a range of new SSL context options for improved encrypted stream
  server security (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/improved-tls-defaults):

    . "honor_cipher_order" allows servers to prioritize cipher suites of their
      choosing when negotiating SSL/TLS handshakes.
    . "single_ecdh_use" and "single_dh_use" allow for improved forward
      secrecy in encrypted stream servers.
    . "dh_param" allows specification of pre-generated key generation
       parameters when negotiating ephemeral DHE ciphers in stream servers.
    . "ecdh_curve" allows stream servers to specify which curve to use when
       negotiating ephemeral ECDHE ciphers (defaults to NIST P-256).
    . "rsa_key_size" SSL context option gives stream servers control
      over the key size (in bits) used when negotiating RSA ciphers.
    . "capture_session_meta" if specified stores an array of data describing
      the TLS session's protocol/cipher in the "session_meta" SSL context key.

- Added automatic mitigation against client-initated TLS renegotiation DoS
  attacks in encrypted server streams. Renegotiation limiting may be
  customized via three new SSL context options:

    . "reneg_limit" (number of allowed renegotiations per time window)
    . "reneg_window" (renegotiation time window in seconds)
    . "reneg_limit_callback" (optional notification callback on limiting)

- Encrypted TLS servers now support the server name indication (SNI) TLS
  extension via the new "SNI_server_certs" SSL context option.

- Added "crypto_method" SSL context option for use in encrypted streams.

- Added "peer_name" SSL context option to better reflect peer certificate
  name matching using SAN extension (replaces deprecated "CN_match").

- Added stream wrapper support when specifying "cafile" SSL context paths.

- Independent peer cert and peer name validation is now available via a new
  boolean "verify_peer_name" SSL context option. This option is enabled by
  default in encrypted client streams.

- Added protocol-specific tlsv1.0://, tlsv1.1:// and tlsv1.2:// encryption
  stream wrappers. tls:// wrapper now supports TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 (previously
  only supported TLSv1).

- Stream crypto method specification now accepts flags instead of values
  allowing support for multiple discrete protocols in a given stream.

- PostgreSQL database connections may now be established asynchronously using
  new constants and polling functions in ext/pgsql.

- Non-blocking read/write query behavior now optionally available in database
  operations using the ext/pgsql extension.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

- Added phpdbg SAPI.
  (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/phpdbg)

- Support for FPM workers changing the apparmor profile through the pool configuration.
  (https://wiki.php.net/rfc/fpm_change_hat)

- Support for several XML MIME types in the built-in CLI server. For static
  files with extensions .xml, .xsl, .xsd the Content-Type header
  application/xml is now sent automatically.

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

- Incompatible context calls:
  Instance calls from an incompatible context are now deprecated and issue
  E_DEPRECATED instead of E_STRICT. See https://wiki.php.net/rfc/incompat_ctx

- The "CN_match" and "SNI_server_name" SSL context options are deprecated in
  favor of the new "peer_name" option. Name verification now checks certificate
  SAN names as well as the CN field and the specific name fields are deprecated
  to avoid confusion. Their use triggers E_DEPRECATED but continues to work as
  before. If specified, the specific values take precedence over the general
  "peer_name" value.

- Deprecated PDO::PGSQL_ATTR_DISABLE_NATIVE_PREPARED_STATEMENT, an
  undocument constant effectively equivalent to PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES.

- Deprecated INIs: Following INIs are deprecated in favour of new
  internal_encoding/input_encoding/output_encoding. Refer to "Changes to
  encodings in PHP 5.6" in "11. Other Changes" section for more details.

    iconv.input_encoding
    iconv.output_encoding
    iconv.internal_encoding
    mbstring.http_input
    mbstring.http_output
    mbstring.internal_encoding

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

- cURL:
  CURLOPT_SAFE_UPLOAD is now turned on by default and uploads with @file 
  do not work unless it is explicitly set to false.

  curl_setopt() now supports the following nullable settings (>= 5.5.11): 
    . CURLOPT_CUSTOMREQUEST
    . CURLOPT_FTPPORT
    . CURLOPT_RANGE
    . CURLOPT_FTP_ACCOUNT
    . CURLOPT_RTSP_SESSION_ID
    . CURLOPT_KRBLEVEL
    . CURLOPT_KRB4LEVEL

  curl_getinfo($ch, CURLINFO_CERTINFO) returns certificate Subject and Issuer
  as a string (PHP >= 5.6.25)

- Strings:
  substr_compare() now allows $length to be zero.
  pack() and unpack() now support 64-bit format specifiers: q, Q, J and P.

- Crypt:
  crypt() will now raise an E_NOTICE error if the salt parameter is omitted.
  See: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/crypt_function_salt

- Mcrypt:
  The $source parameter of mcrypt_create_iv() now defaults to
  MCRYPT_DEV_URANDOM instead of MCRYPT_DEV_RANDOM.

- OpenSSL:
  The $crypto_type parameter is now optional in stream_socket_enable_crypto()
  if the stream's SSL context specifies the new "crypto_type" option. The
  crypto method from the context is used as a fallback if no crypto method is
  specified at call-time.

- Reflection:
  ReflectionClass::newInstanceWithoutConstructor previously didn't allow the
  instantiation of any internal class which used custom object storage
  (overriding the default create_object handler), this was changed to only
  reject the instantiation of such classes if the class is also marked as
  final.

- XMLReader:
  XMLReader::getAttributeNs and XMLReader::getAttributeNo now return NULL if
  the attribute could not be found, just like XMLReader::getAttribute.

- Pgsql:
  pg_insert()/pg_select()/pg_update()/pg_delete() are no longer EXPERIMENTAL.
  The following functions no longer block until query write completion if the
  socket stream underlying a database connection is set to non-blocking mode:
    . pg_send_execute()
    . pg_send_prepare()
    . pg_send_query()
    . pg_send_query_params()

- unserialize:
  Manipulated serialization strings for objects implementing Serializable by
  replacing "C:" with "O:" at the start will now produce an error.

- parse_ini_file():
- parse_ini_string():
  Added scanner mode INI_SCANNER_TYPED to yield typed .ini values. 
  For PHP >= 5.6.1

- JSON:
  Added JSON_PRESERVE_ZERO_FRACTION option (PHP >= 5.6.5)

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

- Datetime:
  Added DatePeriod::getStartDate(), DatePeriod::getEndDate(), DatePeriod::getDateInterval() in 5.6.5.

  Added gmp_export($gmpnumber, $word_size = 1, $options = GMP_MSW_FIRST | GMP_NATIVE_ENDIAN) in PHP 5.6.1.
  Added gmp_random_range() and gmp_random_bits() in PHP 5.6.3.

- Hash
  Added hash_equals($known_string, $user_string)

- OpenSSL:
  Added string openssl_x509_fingerprint($x509, $type, $binary).
  Added string openssl_spki_new($private_key, $challenge, $algorithm)

  Added string openssl_spki_export_challenge($spkac)
  Added array openssl_get_cert_locations()

- LDAP:
  Added ldap_escape($value, $ignore = "", $flags = 0).
  Added ldap_modify_batch($link_identifier, $dn, $modifications) described in 
  https://wiki.php.net/rfc/ldap_modify_batch.

- Pgsql:
  Added pg_socket($connection) to allow async connections and non-blocking IO
  Added pg_connect_poll($connection) for establishing async connections
  Added pg_consume_input($connection) for non-blocking query result consumption
  Added pg_flush($connection) for non-blocking query write completion

- PDO_pgsql
  Added PDO::pgsqlGetNotify($result_type = PDO::FETCH_USE_DEFAULT, $ms_timeout = 0)
  Added PDO::pgsqlGetPid()

- Reflection
  Added ReflectionFunction::isVariadic() and ReflectionParameter::isVariadic().

- SPL
  Added SplFileObject::fread($length) to complement fwrite() method (>= 5.5.11)

- Zip:
  Added ZipArchive::setPassword($password)

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================


========================================
8. Removed Extensions
========================================


========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================

- cURL:
  - The following constants have been removed as they are now marked "obsolete"
    in the underlying library and never had any effect to begin with:
      . CURLOPT_CLOSEPOLICY
      . CURLCLOSEPOLICY_CALLBACK
      . CURLCLOSEPOLICY_LEAST_RECENTLY_USED
      . CURLCLOSEPOLICY_LEAST_TRAFFIC
      . CURLCLOSEPOLICY_OLDEST
      . CURLCLOSEPOLICY_SLOWEST

- GMP:
  The GMP extension now uses objects as the underlying data structure, rather
  than resources. GMP instances now support dumping, serialization, cloning,
  casts to primitive types and have overloaded operators.
  (RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/operator_overloading_gmp)

- OCI8:
  - Added Implicit Result Set support for Oracle Database 12c with a
    new oci_get_implicit_resultset() function.
  - Using 'oci_execute($s, OCI_NO_AUTO_COMMIT)' for a SELECT no longer
    unnecessarily initiates an internal ROLLBACK during connection
    close.
  - Multi-row OCI_RETURN_LOB queries require fewer "round trips" to the database.
  - Added DTrace probes enabled with PHP's generic --enable-dtrace
  - The oci_internal_debug() function is now a no-op.
  - The phpinfo() output format for OCI8 has changed.

- OpenSSL:
  - The "SNI_enabled" SSL stream context option is now set to TRUE by default
    if supported by the underlying openssl library.

- PCRE:
  - The information collected by the (*MARK) backtracking control verb is now
    collected into the "MARK" index of the $matches array for preg_match(),
    preg_match_all() and preg_replace_callback().

- Pgsql:
  - pg_insert()/pg_select()/pg_update()/pg_delete()/pg_meta_data()/pg_convert()
    are no longer EXPERIMENTAL
  - Added PGSQL_DML_ESCAPE option for pg_insert()/pg_select()/pg_update()/pg_delete()
    that simply escapes all supplied parameters. These functions can be as fast as
    native query. Unvalidated data(Unknown data types) is passed as string.
    JSON/Array/etc are supported both PGSQL_DML_ESCAPE and pg_convert() as string.
  - pg_select() returns PostgreSQL query resource when query is executed.
  - Added extended flag parameter for pg_meta_data(). pg_meta_data() always
    returns "is enum" attribute.
  - The new pg_socket() function returns a socket stream with no behavior other
    than to allow IO-readiness polling on a DB connection socket. Calling
    stream_set_blocking() on its result enables non-blocking behavior.
  - Passing the new PGSQL_CONNECT_ASYNC flag to pg_connect() allows applications
    to poll for IO readiness via pg_connect_poll() and establish connections
    asynchronously.

- PDO_pgsql:
  - Added PDO::PGSQL_ATTR_DISABLE_PREPARES constant to execute the queries
    without preparing them, while still passing parameters separately from
    the command text using PQexecParams.
  - Added LISTEN/NOTIFY support via PDO::pgsqlGetNotify / PDO::pgsqlGetPid()
    as described in https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=42614.

- DOM:
  - DOMNode::textContent is now a writeable property. (>= 5.6.1)

========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

- CURL:
  CURL_HTTP_VERSION_2_0 and CURL_VERSION_HTTP2 (>= 5.6.8)

- GD:
  IMG_WEBP (>= 5.6.25)

- LDAP:
  LDAP_ESCAPE_FILTER int(1)
  LDAP_ESCAPE_DN     int(2)

- Pgsql:
  PGSQL_DML_ESCAPE   int(4096)
  PGSQL_CONNECT_ASYNC
  PGSQL_CONNECTION_STARTED
  PGSQL_CONNECTION_MADE
  PGSQL_CONNECTION_AWAITING_RESPONSE
  PGSQL_CONNECTION_AUTH_OK
  PGSQL_CONNECTION_SSL_STARTUP
  PGSQL_CONNECTION_SETENV
  PGSQL_POLLING_FAILED
  PGSQL_POLLING_READING
  PGSQL_POLLING_WRITING
  PGSQL_POLLING_OK
  PGSQL_POLLING_ACTIVE

- OpenSSL:
  STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_0_CLIENT   int(9)
  STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_1_CLIENT   int(17)
  STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_2_CLIENT   int(33)
  STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_ANY_CLIENT       int(63)
  STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_0_SERVER   int(8)
  STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_1_SERVER   int(16)
  STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_TLSv1_2_SERVER   int(32)
  STREAM_CRYPTO_METHOD_ANY_SERVER       int(62)
  OPENSSL_DEFAULT_STREAM_CIPHERS        string

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

- Core:
  Changed always_populate_raw_post_data to throw a deprecation warning when
  enabled and to recognize the value -1 for never populating the global 
  $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA variable, which will be default in future PHP versions.

  default_charset is set to UTF-8. It was empty previously. default_charset
  is used where it is applicable. Iconv/Mbstring/htmlentities/htmlspecialchars/
  html_entity_decode use default_charset as default encoding.

  internal_encoding/input_encoding/output_encoding is added for encoding
  handling modules. Refer to "Changes to encodings in PHP 5.6" in "11. Other Changes"
  section for more details.

- cURL:
  If the new openssl.cafile ini directive is specified ext/curl will give the
  openssl path precedence over its own curl.cainfo directive.

- OpenSSL:
  openssl.cafile and openssl.capath ini directives have been added to allow
  global CA default specification as necessary.

========================================
12. Other Changes
========================================

- File upload:
  Uploads equal or greater than 2GB in size are now accepted.

- HTTP stream wrapper:
  HTTP 1.1 requests now include a Connection: close header unless explicitly
  overridden by setting a Connection header via the header context option.

- PDO_pgsql
  A libpq version providing PQexecParams, PQprepare, PQescapeStringConn,
  PQescapeByteaConn is now required. According to the release notes that means
  8.0.8+ or 8.1.4+. 

- Zip:
  New --with-libzip option allow to use system libzip. Version > 0.11 required,
  Version >= 0.11.2 recommended for all features.

- Changes to encodings in PHP 5.6
  The default value of default_charset is now UTF-8 when it is not
  explicitly set in php.ini

  The following php.ini parameters were added:
    internal_encoding
    input_encoding
    output_encoding

  The values of the following php.ini parameters have become empty in
  PHP 5.6 (previously they were all ISO-8859-1)

    iconv.input_encoding
    iconv.output_encoding
    iconv.internal_encoding

  Changes were made to character set handling in:
   - the iconv and mbstring extensions,
   - and htmlentities(), htmlspecialchars(), html_entity_decode() functions

  The precedence for these is now:

   default_charset < internal/input/output_encoding < (mbstring.* || iconv.*) < function parameter

  For example, the easiest way to use the UTF-8 encoding is to set
  default_charset=UTF-8 and leave the following php.ini parameters

  empty:

    iconv.input_encoding
    iconv.output_encoding
    iconv.internal_encoding
    mbstring.http_input
    mbstring.http_output
    mbstring.internal_encoding
    internal_encoding
    input_encoding
    output_encoding

  The mb_regex_encoding() default setting is changed from EUC-JP to UTF-8.

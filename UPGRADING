=============================
1. Changes to INI directives
=============================

- PHP 5.4 now checks at compile time if /dev/urandom or /dev/arandom
  are present. If either is available, session.entropy_file now
  defaults to that file and session.entropy_length defaults to 32.
  This provides non-blocking entropy to session id generation. If you
  do not want extra entropy for your session ids, add:

    session.entropy_file=
    session.entropy_length=0

  to your php.ini to preserve pre-PHP 5.4 behavior.

- Deprecated php.ini directives will now throw an E_CORE_WARNING's
  instead of the previous E_WARNING's.

- The following php.ini directives are no longer available in PHP 5.4
  and will now throw an E_CORE_ERROR upon startup:
  - allow_call_time_pass_reference
  - define_syslog_variables
  - highlight.bg
  - magic_quotes_gpc
  - magic_quotes_runtime
  - magic_quotes_sybase
  - register_globals
  - register_long_arrays
  - safe_mode
  - safe_mode_gid
  - safe_mode_include_dir
  - safe_mode_exec_dir
  - safe_mode_allowed_env_vars
  - safe_mode_protected_env_vars
  - session.bug_compat_42
  - session.bug_compat_warn
  - y2k_compliance
  - zend.ze1_compatibility_mode

- the following new php.ini directives were added:
  - max_input_vars - specifies how many GET/POST/COOKIE input
    variables may be accepted. The default value is 1000.

- E_ALL now includes E_STRICT.

- The recommended production value for error_reporting changed to E_ALL &
  ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT.

- Added new session support directives:
    session.upload_progress.enabled
    session.upload_progress.cleanup
    session.upload_progress.prefix
    session.upload_progress.name
    session.upload_progress.freq
    session.upload_progress.min_freq

- Added a zend.multibyte directive as a replacement of the PHP compile time
  configuration option --enable-zend-multibyte. Now the Zend Engine always
  contains code for multibyte support, which can be enabled or disabled at
  runtime. Note: It doesn't make a lot of sense to enable this option if
  ext/mbstring is not enabled, because most functionality is implemented by
  mbstrings callbacks.

- Added zend.script_encoding. This value will be used unless a
  "declare(encoding=...)" directive appears at the top of the script.

- Added zend.signal_check to check for replaced signal handlers on shutdown

- Added enable_post_data_reading, which is enabled by default. When it's
  disabled, the POST data is not read (or processed); the behavior is similar
  to that of other request methods with body, like PUT. This allows reading
  the raw POST data in multipart requests and reading/processing the POST data
  in a stream fashion (through php://input) without having it copied in memory
  multiple times.

- Added windows_show_crt_warning. This directive shows the CRT warnings when
  enabled. These warnings were displayed by default until now. It is disabled
  by default.

- Added cli.pager to set a pager for CLI interactive shell output.

- Added cli.prompt to configure the CLI interactive shell prompt.

- Added cli_server.color to enable the CLI web server to use ANSI color coding
  in terminal output.

========================================
2. Changes to reserved words and classes
========================================

- "callable", "insteadof" and "trait" are now reserved words.

=============================
3. Changes to engine behavior
=============================

- The __construct arguments of an extended abstract constructor must
  now match:

  abstract class Base
  {
    abstract public function __construct();
  }
  class Foo extends Base
  {
    public function __construct($bar) {}
  }

  This now emits a Fatal error due the incompatible declaration.

- In previous versions, superglobal names could be used for parameter
  names, thereby shadowing the corresponding superglobal. In PHP 5.4
  this now causes a fatal error such as "Cannot re-assign auto-global
  variable GLOBALS".

- Turning null, false or an empty string into an object by adding a
  property will now emit a warning instead of an E_STRICT error.

  $test = null;
  $test->baz = 1;

  To create a generic object you can use StdClass:

  $test = new StdClass;
  $test->baz = 1;

- Converting an array to a string now will cause an E_NOTICE warning.

- Non-numeric string offsets, e.g. $a['foo'] where $a is a string, now
  return false on isset() and true on empty(), and produce warning if
  trying to use them. Offsets of types double, bool and null produce
  notice. Numeric strings ($a['2']) still work as before.

  Note that offsets like '12.3' and '5 and a half' are considered
  non-numeric and produce warning, but are converted to 12 and 5
  respectively for backwards compatibility reasons.

- Long numeric strings that do not fit in integer or double (such as
  "92233720368547758070") are compared using string comparison if 
  they could otherwise result in precision loss - since 5.4.4.

- Closures now support scopes and $this and can be rebound to
  objects using Closure::bind() and Closure::bindTo().

- <?= is now always available regardless of the short_open_tag
  setting.

- Parse error messages are changed to contain more information about
  the error.

- __clone and __destruct since 5.4.4 follow the same scoping rules as 
  the rest of the methods (see bug #61782 for details).

================================
4. Changes to existing functions
================================

- array_combine now returns array() instead of FALSE when two empty arrays are
  provided as parameters.

- dns_get_record() has an extra parameter which allows requesting DNS records
  by numeric type and makes the result include only the raw data of the
  response.

- call_user_func_array() no longer allows call-time pass by reference.

- the default character set for htmlspecialchars() and htmlentities() is
  now UTF-8. In previous versions it was ISO-8859-1. Note that changing
  your output charset via the php.ini default_charset directive does not
  affect htmlspecialchars/htmlentities unless you are passing "" (an 
  empty string) as the encoding parameter to your htmlspecialchars/htmlentities
  calls. 

- htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars() are stricter in the code units they
  accept for the asian encodings. For Big5-HKSCS, the octets 0x80 and 0xFF are
  rejected. For GB2312/EUC-CN, the octets 0x8E, 0x8F, 0xA0 and 0xFF are
  rejected. For SJIS, the octets 0x80, 0xA0, 0xFD, 0xFE and 0xFF are rejected,
  except maybe after a valid starting byte. For EUC-JP, the octets 0xA0 and
  0xFF are rejected.

- htmlentities() now emits an E_STRICT warning when used with asian characters,
  as in that case htmlentities has (and already had before this version) the
  same functionality as htmlspecialchars.

- htmlentities() no longer numerically encodes high characters for single-byte
  encodings (except when there's actually a corresponding named entity). This
  behavior was not documented and was inconsistent with that for "UTF-8".

- html_entity_decode() and htmlspecialchars_decode() behave more consistently,
  now decoding entities in malformed strings such as "&&amp;" or "&#&amp;".

- htmlentities(), htmlspecialchars(), html_entity_decode(), and
  htmlspecialchars_decode: Added the flags ENT_HTML401, ENT_XML1, ENT_XHTML,
  and ENT_HTML5. The behavior of these functions including, but not limited to,
  the characters that are encoded and the entities that are decoded depend on
  the document type that is specified by those flags.

- htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars() with !$double_encode do more strict
  checks on the validity of the entities. Numerical entities are checked for a
  valid range (0 to 0x10FFFF); if the flag ENT_DISALLOWED is given, the
  validity of such numerical entity in the target document type is also
  checked. Named entities are checked for necessary existence in the target
  document type instead of only checking whether they were constituted by
  alphanumeric characters.

- The flag ENT_DISALLOWED was added. In addition to the behavior described in
  the item before, it also makes htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars()
  substitute characters that appear literally in the argument string and which
  are not allowed in the target document type with U+FFFD (UTF-8) or &#xFFFD;.

- The flag ENT_SUBSTITUTE was added. This flag makes invalid multibyte
  sequences be replaced by U+FFFD (UTF-8) or &#FFFD; by htmlspecialchars() and
  htmlentities(). It is an alternative to the default behavior, which just
  returns an empty string and to ENT_IGNORE, which is a security risk. The
  behavior follows the recommendations of Unicode Technical Report #36.

- htmlspecialchars_decode() and html_entity_decode() now decode &apos; if the
  document type is ENT_XML1, ENT_XHTML, or ENT_HTML5.

- Charset detection with $charset == '' no longer turns to mbstring's
  internal encoding defined through mb_internal_encoding(). Only the encoding
  defined through the php.ini setting mbstring.internal_encoding is considered.

- number_format() no longer truncates multibyte decimal points and thousand
  separators to the first byte.

- The third parameter ($matches) to preg_match_all() is now optional. If
  omitted, the function will simply return the number of times the pattern was
  matched in the subject and will have no other side effects.

- The second argument of scandir() now accepts SCANDIR_SORT_NONE (2) as a
  possible value. This value results in scandir() performing no sorting: on
  local filesystems, this allows files to be returned in native filesystem
  order.

- stream_select() now preserves the keys of the passed array, be they numeric or
  strings. This breaks code that iterated the resulting stream array using a
  numeric index, but makes easier to identify which of the passed streams are
  present in the result.

- stream_set_write_buffer() no longer disables the read buffer of a plain
  stream when 0 is given as the second argument.

- stream_set_write_buffer() no longer changes the chunk size in socket streams.

- fclose() closes streams with resource refcount > 1; it doesn't merely
  decrement the resource refcount.

- socket_set_options() and socket_get_options() now support multicast options.

- The raw data parameter in openssl_encrypt() and openssl_decrypt() is now an
  options integer rather than a boolean. A value of true produces the same
  behavior.

- Write operations within XSLT (for example with the extension sax:output) are
  disabled by default. You can define what is forbidden with the method
  XsltProcess::setSecurityPrefs($options).

- Added AES support to OpenSSL.

- openssl_csr_new() expects the textual data to be in UTF-8.

- Added no-padding option to openssl_encrypt() and openssl_decrypt().

- Added a "no_ticket" SSL context option to disable the SessionTicket TLS
  extension.

- Added new json_encode() options: JSON_PRETTY_PRINT, JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES,
  JSON_NUMERIC_CHECK, JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING, JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE.

- Added Tokyo Cabinet and Berkley DB 5 support to DBA extension.

- Added support for CURLOPT_MAX_SEND_SPEED_LARGE and CURLOPT_MAX_RECV_SPEED_LARGE
  to cURL.

- Added optional argument to debug_backtrace() and debug_print_backtrace()
  to limit the amount of stack frames returned.

- Fixed crypt_blowfish handling of 8-bit characters. crypt() in Blowfish mode
  now supports hashes marked $2a$, $2x$, $2y$ and $2z$.

- mbstring now supports following encodings: Shift_JIS/UTF-8 Emoji,
  JIS X0213:2004 (Shift_JIS-2004, EUC-JP-2004, ISO-2022-JP-2004),
  MacJapanese (Shift_JIS), gb18030.

- Added encode and decode in hex format to mb_encode_numericentity() and
  mb_decode_numericentity().

- Added support for SORT_NATURAL and SORT_FLAG_CASE in array sort functions:
  sort(), rsort(), ksort(), krsort(), asort(), arsort() and array_multisort().

- is_a() and is_subclass_of() now have third boolean parameter, which specifies
  if the first argument can be a string class name. Default if false for is_a
  and true for is_subclass_of() for BC reasons.

- ob_start() will now treat a chunk size of 1 as meaning 1 byte, rather than
  the previous special case behavior of treating it as 4096 bytes.

- idn_to_ascii() and idn_to_utf8() now take two extra parameters, one indicating
  the variant (IDNA 2003 or UTS #46) and another, passed by reference, to return
  details about the operation in case UTS #46 is chosen.

- gzencode() used with FORCE_DEFLATE now generates RFC1950 compliant data.

- ob_start() no longer starts multiple output buffers when passed
  array("callback1", "callback2", "callback3", ...).

- Since 5.4.4, "php://fd" stream syntax is available only in CLI build.

- Since 5.4.5, resourcebundle_create() accepts null for the first two arguments.

- Since 5.4.6, SimpleXMLElement::getDocNamespaces() has and extra parameter which
  allows for toggling if the list of namespaces starts from the document root
  or from the node you call the method on

- Since 5.4.7, ctor is always called when new user stream wrapper object is created.
  Before, it was called only when stream_open was called.

==============================
5. Changes to existing classes
==============================

- Classes that implement stream wrappers can define a method called
  stream_truncate that will respond to truncation, e.g. through ftruncate.
  Strictly speaking, this is an addition to the user-space stream wrapper
  template, not a change to an actual class.

- Classes that implement stream wrappers can define a method called
  stream_metadata that will be called on touch(), chmod(), chgrp(), chown().

- Arrays cast from SimpleXMLElement now always contain all nodes instead of
  just the first matching node.

- All SimpleXMLElement children are now always printed when using var_dump(),
  var_export(), and print_r().

- Added iterator support in MySQLi. mysqli_result implements Traversable.

==============================
6. Changes to existing methods
==============================

- DateTime::parseFromFormat() now has a "+" modifier to allow trailing text in
  the string to parse without throwing an error.

- Added the ability to pass options to DOMDocument::loadHTML().

- FilesystemIterator, GlobIterator and (Recursive)DirectoryIterator now use
  the default stream context.

- Since 5.4.5, the constructor of ResourceBundle accepts NULL for the first two
  arguments.

===========================
7. Deprecated Functionality
===========================

- The following functions are deprecated in PHP 5.4:
  - mcrypt_generic_end():       use mcrypt_generic_deinit() instead
  - mysql_list_dbs()

========================
8. Removed Functionality
========================

a. Removed features

   The following features have been removed from PHP 5.4:

   - Magic quotes
   - Register globals
   - Safe mode
   - Session extension bug compatibility mode
   - Y2K compliance mode

b. Removed functions

   The following functions are no longer available in PHP 5.4:

   - define_syslog_variables()
   - import_request_variables()
   - session_is_registered()
   - session_register()
   - session_unregister()
   - set_magic_quotes_runtime()
   - mysqli_bind_param() (alias of mysqli_stmt_bind_param())
   - mysqli_bind_result() (alias of mysqli_stmt_bind_result())
   - mysqli_client_encoding() (alias of mysqli_character_set_name())
   - mysqli_fetch() (alias of mysqli_stmt_fetch())
   - mysqli_param_count() (alias of mysqli_stmt_param_count())
   - mysqli_get_metadata() (alias of mysqli_stmt_result_metadata())
   - mysqli_send_long_data() (alias of mysqli_stmt_send_long_data())
   - mysqli::client_encoding() (alias of mysqli::character_set_name)
   - mysqli_stmt::stmt() (never worked/always throws, undocumented)

c. Removed syntax

   - break $var;
   - continue $var;

d. Removed hash algorithms

   - Salsa10 and Salsa20, which are actually stream ciphers

====================
9. Extension Changes
====================

a. Extensions no longer maintained

   - ext/sqlite is no longer part of the base distribution and has been moved
     to PECL. Use sqlite3 or PDO_SQLITE instead.

b. Extensions with changed behavior

   - The MySQL extensions (ext/mysql, mysqli and PDO_MYSQL) use mysqlnd
     as the default library now. It is still possible to use libmysql by
     specifying a path to the configure options.

   - PDO_MYSQL: Support for linking with MySQL client libraries older
     than 4.1 is removed.

   - The session extension now can hook into the file upload feature
     in order to provide upload progress information through session
     variables.

   - SNMP extension
     - Functions in SNMP extension now returns FALSE on every error
       condition including SNMP-related (no such instance, end of MIB,
       etc). Thus, in patricular, breaks previous behavior of get/walk
       functions returning an empty string on SNMP-related errors.
     - Multi OID get/getnext/set queries are now supported.
     - New constants added for use in snmp_set_oid_output_format()
       function.
     - Function snmp_set_valueretrieval() changed it's behavior:
	    SNMP_VALUE_OBJECT can be combined with one of
	    SNMP_VALUE_PLAIN or SNMP_VALUE_LIBRARY resulting OID value
	    changes. When no SNMP_VALUE_PLAIN or SNMP_VALUE_LIBRARY
	    is supplied with SNMP_VALUE_OBJECT, SNMP_VALUE_LIBRARY is used.
	    Prior to 5.4.0 when no SNMP_VALUE_PLAIN or SNMP_VALUE_LIBRARY
	    was supplied with SNMP_VALUE_OBJECT, SNMP_VALUE_PLAIN was used.
     - Added feature-rich OO API (SNMP class)
     - Dropped UCD-SNMP compatibility code. Consider upgrading to
       net-snmp v5.3+. Net-SNMP v5.4+ is required for Windows version.
     - In sake of adding support for IPv6 DNS name resolution of
       remote SNMP agent (peer) is done by extension now, not by Net-SNMP
       library anymore.

   - Date extension
     - Setting the timezone with the TZ environment variable is no longer
       supported, instead date.timezone and/or date_default_timezone_set()
       have to be used.
     - The extension will no longer guess the default timezone if none
       is set with date.timezone and/or date_default_timezone_set().
       Instead it will always fall back to "UTC".

   - Hash extension
     - the output of the tiger hash family has been corrected, see
       https://bugs.php.net/61307

===========================
10. Changes in SAPI support
===========================

- A REQUEST_TIME_FLOAT value returns a floating point number indicating the
  time with microsecond precision. All SAPIs providing this value should be
  returning float and not time_t.

- apache_child_terminate(), getallheaders(), apache_request_headers()
  and apache_response_headers() are now supported on FastCGI.

- The interactive shell allows a shortcut #inisetting=value to change php.ini
  settings at run-time.

- The interactive shell now works with the shared readline extension.

- The interactive shell no longer terminates on fatal errors.

- A new PHP CLI command line option --rz <name> shows information about the
  named Zend extension.

===================
11. Windows support
===================

- is_link now works properly for symbolic links on Windows Vista
  or later. Earlier systems do not support symbolic links.

- As of PHP 5.4.5 and above the COM extension isn't compiled statically in PHP
  anymore but shared. It'll still be delivered with the standard PHP release but
  must be activated manually with the "extension = php_com_dotnet.dll" directive
  in php.ini.

- Apache 2.4 handler is supported as of PHP 5.4.9

==================
12. New in PHP 5.4
==================

a. New Features

  - A built-in CLI web server for testing purposes is now available:
     $ php -S 127.0.0.1:8888

  - File Upload Progress support is implemented in the Session extension.

b. Syntax additions

  - Traits:
      trait HelloWorld {
	  public function sayHello() {
	      echo 'Hello World!';
	  }
      }

      class CanIGetHello {
	  use HelloWorld;
      }

      $hello = new CanIGetHello();
      $hello->sayHello();

  - Function call result array access, e.g.:
      foo()[0]
      $foo->bar()[0]

  - Callable typehint indicating argument must be callable:
      function foo(callable $do) {
      }
      foo("strcmp");
      foo(function() {});
      $o = new ArrayObject();
      foo(array($o, "count"));

  - Short array syntax:
      $a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
      $a = ['one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => 3, 'four' => 4];
      $a = ['one' => 1, 2, 'three' => 3, 4];

  - Binary number format:
      0b00100 0b010101

  - Chained string array offsets now work.
      $a = "abc";
      echo $a[0][0];

  - Anonymous functions now support using $this and class scope.
    Anonymous function can be declared as "static" to ignore the scope.

  - Class::{expr}() syntax is now supported:
      class A {
	  static function foo() {
	      echo "Hello world!\n";
	  }
      }
      $x = "f";
      $y = "o";
      A::{$x.$y.$y}();

  - Class member access on instantiation:
      (new foo)->method()
      (new foo)->property
      (new foo)[0]

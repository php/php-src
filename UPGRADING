========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- Core:
  . Methods with the same name as the class are no longer interpreted as
    constructors. The __construct() method should be used instead.
  . Removed ability to call non-static methods statically.
  . Removed (unset) cast.
  . Removed track_errors ini directive. This means that $php_errormsg is no
    longer available. The error_get_last() function may be used instead.
  . Removed the ability to define case-insensitive constants. The third
    argument to define() may no longer be true.
  . Access to undefined constants now always results in an Error exception.
    Previously, unqualified constant accesses resulted in a warning and were
    interpreted as strings.
  . Removed ability to specify an autoloader using an __autoload() function.
    spl_autoload_register() should be used instead.
  . Removed the $errcontext argument for custom error handlers.
  . Removed create_function(). Anonymous functions may be used instead.
  . Removed each(). foreach or ArrayIterator should be used instead.
  . Removed ability to unbind $this from closures that were created from a
    method, using Closure::fromCallable() or ReflectionMethod::getClosure().
  . Also removed ability to unbind $this from proper closures that contain uses
    of $this.
  . Removed ability to use array_key_exists() with objects. Use one of isset()
    or property_exists() instead.
  . Any array that has a number n as its first numeric key will use n+1 for
    its next implicit key. Even if n is negative.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/negative_array_index
  . The default error_reporting level is now E_ALL. Previously it excluded
    E_NOTICE and E_DEPRECATED.
  . display_startup_errors is now enabled by default.
  . Using "parent" inside a class that has no parent will now result in a
    fatal compile-time error.
  . The @ operator will no longer silence fatal errors (E_ERROR, E_CORE_ERROR,
    E_COMPILE_ERROR, E_USER_ERROR, E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR, E_PARSE). Error handlers
    that expect error_reporting to be 0 when @ is used, should be adjusted to
    use a mask check instead:

        // Replace
        function my_error_handler($err_no, $err_msg, $filename, $linenum) {
            if (error_reporting() == 0) {
                return; // Silenced
            }
            // ...
        }

        // With
        function my_error_handler($err_no, $err_msg, $filename, $linenum) {
            if (!(error_reporting() & $err_no)) {
                return; // Silenced
            }
            // ...
        }

    Additionally, care should be taken that error messages are not displayed in
    production environments, which can result in information leaks. Please
    ensure that display_errors=Off is used in conjunction with error logging.
  . Inheritance errors due to incompatible method signatures (LSP violations)
    will now always generate a fatal error. Previously a warning was generated
    in some cases.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/lsp_errors
  . The precedence of the concatenation operator has changed relative to
    bitshifts and addition as well as subtraction.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/concatenation_precedence
  . Arguments with a default-value that resolves to null at run-time will no
    longer implicitly mark the argument type as nullable. Either use an explicit
    nullable type, or an explicit null default value instead.

        // Replace
        function test(int $arg = CONST_RESOLVING_TO_NULL) {}
        // With
        function test(?int $arg = CONST_RESOLVING_TO_NULL) {}
        // Or
        function test(int $arg = null) {}
  . A number of warnings have been converted into Error exceptions:

    * Attempting to write to a property of a non-object. Previously this
      implicitly created an stdClass object for null, false and empty strings.
    * Attempting to append an element to an array for which the PHP_INT_MAX key
      is already used.
    * Attempting to use an invalid type (array or object) as an array key or
      string offset.
    * Attempting to write to an array index of a scalar value.
    * Attempting to unpack a non-array/Traversable.

    A number of notices have been converted into warnings:

    * Attempting to read an undefined variable.
    * Attempting to read an undefined property.
    * Attempting to read a property of a non-object.
    * Attempting to access an array index of a non-array.
    * Attempting to convert an array to string.
    * Attempting to use a resource as an array key.
    * Attempting to use null, a boolean or a float as a string offset.
    * Attempting to read an out-of-bounds string offset.

    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/engine_warnings
  . Unexpected characters in source files (such as null bytes outside of
    strings) will now result in a ParseError exception instead of a compile
    warning.
  . Uncaught exceptions now go through "clean shutdown", which means that
    destructors will be called after an uncaught exception.

- COM:
  . Removed the ability to import case-insensitive constants from type
    libraries. The second argument to com_load_typelib() may no longer be false;
    com.autoregister_casesensitive may no longer be disabled; case-insensitive
    markers in com.typelib_file are ignored.

- Date:
  . mktime() and gmmktime() now require at least one argument. time() can be
    used to get the current timestamp.

- dom:
  . Remove unimplemented classes from ext/dom that had no behavior and contained
    test data. These classes have also been removed in the latest version of DOM
	standard:

     * DOMNameList
     * DomImplementationList
     * DOMConfiguration
     * DomError
     * DomErrorHandler
     * DOMImplementationSource
     * DOMLocator
     * DOMUserDataHandler
     * DOMTypeInfo

- Exif:
  . Removed read_exif_data(). exif_read_data() should be used instead.

- Filter:
  . The FILTER_FLAG_SCHEME_REQUIRED and FILTER_FLAG_HOST_REQUIRED flags for the
    FILTER_VALIDATE_URL filter have been removed. The scheme and host are (and
    have been) always required.
  . The INPUT_REQUEST and INPUT_SESSION source for filter_input() etc have been
    removed. These were never implemented and their use always generated a
    warning.

- GD:
  . The GD extension now uses objects as the underlying data structure for
    images, rather than resources. These objects are completely opaque, i.e.
    they don't have any methods.
  . The deprecated function image2wbmp() has been removed.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/image2wbmp
  . The deprecated functions png2wbmp() and jpeg2wbmp() have been removed.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate-png-jpeg-2wbmp
  . The default $mode parameter of imagecropauto() no longer accepts -1.
    IMG_CROP_DEFAULT should be used instead.

- GMP:
  . gmp_random() has been removed. One of gmp_random_range() or
    gmp_random_bits() should be used instead.

- Intl:
  . The deprecated constant INTL_IDNA_VARIANT_2003 has been removed.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate-and-remove-intl_idna_variant_2003
  . The deprecated Normalizer::NONE constant has been removed.

- LDAP:
  . The deprecated function ldap_sort has been removed.

- Mbstring:
  . The mbstring.func_overload directive has been removed. The related
    MB_OVERLOAD_MAIL, MB_OVERLOAD_STRING, and MB_OVERLOAD_REGEX constants have
    also been removed. Finally, the "func_overload" and "func_overload_list"
    entries in mb_get_info() have been removed.
  . mb_parse_str() can no longer be used without specifying a result array.
  . A number of deprecated mbregex aliases have been removed. See the following
    list for which functions should be used instead:

     * mbregex_encoding()      -> mb_regex_encoding()
     * mbereg()                -> mb_ereg()
     * mberegi()               -> mb_eregi()
     * mbereg_replace()        -> mb_ereg_replace()
     * mberegi_replace()       -> mb_eregi_replace()
     * mbsplit()               -> mb_split()
     * mbereg_match()          -> mb_ereg_match()
     * mbereg_search()         -> mb_ereg_search()
     * mbereg_search_pos()     -> mb_ereg_search_pos()
     * mbereg_search_regs()    -> mb_ereg_search_regs()
     * mbereg_search_init()    -> mb_ereg_search_init()
     * mbereg_search_getregs() -> mb_ereg_search_getregs()
     * mbereg_search_getpos()  -> mb_ereg_search_getpos()
     * mbereg_search_setpos()  -> mb_ereg_search_setpos()

  . The 'e' modifier for mb_ereg_replace() has been removed.
    mb_ereg_replace_callback() should be used instead.
  . A non-string pattern argument to mb_ereg_replace() will now be interpreted
    as a string instead of an ASCII codepoint. The previous behavior may be
    restored with an explicit call to chr().
  . The $is_hex parameter, which was not used internally, has been removed from
    mb_decode_numericentity().

- PCRE:
  . When passing invalid escape sequences they are no longer interpreted as
    literals. This behaviour previously required the X modifier - which is
    now ignored.

- PDO:
  . The method PDOStatement::setFetchMode() now accepts the following signature:

        PDOStatement::setFetchMode($mode, $classname, $params)

- PDO_ODBC:
  . The php.ini directive pdo_odbc.db2_instance_name has been removed

- Reflection:
  . The method signatures

        ReflectionClass::newInstance($args)
        ReflectionFunction::invoke($args)
        ReflectionMethod::invoke($object, $args)

    have been changed to:

        ReflectionClass::newInstance(...$args)
        ReflectionFunction::invoke(...$args)
        ReflectionMethod::invoke($object, ...$args)

    Code that must be compatible with both PHP 7 and PHP 8 can use the following
    signatures to be compatible with both versions:

        ReflectionClass::newInstance($arg = null, ...$args)
        ReflectionFunction::invoke($arg = null, ...$args)
        ReflectionMethod::invoke($object, $arg = null, ...$args)

  . The ReflectionType::__toString() method will now return a complete debug
    representation of the type, and is no longer deprecated. In particular the
    result will include a nullability indicator for nullable types. The format
    of the return value is not stable and may change between PHP versions.

- Socket:
  . The deprecated AI_IDN_ALLOW_UNASSIGNED and AI_IDN_USE_STD3_ASCII_RULES
    flags for socket_addrinfo_lookup() have been removed.

- SPL:
  . SplFileObject::fgetss() has been removed.
  . SplHeap::compare($a, $b) now specifies a method signature. Inheriting
    classes implementing this method will now have to use a compatible
    method signature.

- Standard:
  . assert() will no longer evaluate string arguments, instead they will be
    treated like any other argument. assert($a == $b) should be used instead of
    assert('$a == $b'). The assert.quiet_eval ini directive and
    ASSERT_QUIET_EVAL constants have also been removed, as they would no longer
    have any effect.
  . parse_str() can no longer be used without specifying a result array.
  . fgetss() has been removed.
  . The string.strip_tags filter has been removed.
  . The needle argument of strpos(), strrpos(), stripos(), strripos(), strstr(),
    strchr(), strrchr(), and stristr() will now always be interpreted as a
    string. Previously non-string needles were interpreted as an ASCII code
    point. An explicit call to chr() can be used to restore the previous
    behavior.
  . The needle argument for strpos(), strrpos(), stripos(), strripos(), strstr() and stristr() can now be empty.
  . The length argument for substr(), substr_count(), substr_compare(), and
    iconv_substr() can now be null. Null values will behave as if no length
    argument was provided and will therefore return the remainder of the string
    instead of an empty string.
  . The length argument for array_splice() can now be null. Null values will
    behave identically to omitting the argument, thus removing everything from
    the 'offset' to the end of the array.
  . The 'salt' option of password_hash() is no longer supported. If the 'salt'
    option is used a warning is generated, the provided salt is ignored, and a
    generated salt is used instead.
  . The quotemeta() function will now return an empty string if an empty string
    was passed. Previously false was returned.

- tidy:
  . The $use_include_path parameter, which was not used internally, has been
    removed from tidy_repair_string().

- XML:
  . xml_parser_create(_ns) will now return an XmlParser object rather than a
    resource. Return value checks using is_resource() should be replaced with
    checks for `false`. The xml_parser_free() function no longer has an effect,
    instead the XmlParser instance is automatically destroyed if it is no longer
    referenced.

- XMLWriter:
  . The XMLWriter functions now accept and return, respectively, XMLWriter
    objects instead of resources.

- Zip:
  . The remove_path option of ZipArchive::addGlob() and ::addPattern() is now
    treated as arbitrary string prefix (for consistency with the add_path
    option), whereas formerly it was treated as directory name. This means that
    if no trailing directory separator is given, the following character is
    no longer stripped from the filename.

- Zlib:
  . gzgetss() has been removed.

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- Core:
  . Added support for union types.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/union_types_v2
  . Added ValueError class.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

- Standard:
  . Added fdiv() method, which performs a floating-point division under
    IEEE 754 semantics. Division by zero is considered well-defined and
    will return one of Inf, -Inf or NaN.

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================

========================================
8. Removed Extensions and SAPIs
========================================

========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================

- GD:
  . The $num_points parameter of imagepolygon(), imageopenpolygon() and
    imagefilledpolygon() is now optional, i.e. these functions may be called
    with either 3 or 4 arguments. If the arguments is omitted, it is calculated
    as count($points)/2.

========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

========================================
12. Windows Support
========================================

========================================
13. Other Changes
========================================

========================================
14. Performance Improvements
========================================

- array_slice() on an array without gaps will no longer scan the whole array to find
  the start offset. This may significantly reduce the runtime of the function
  with large offsets and small lengths.

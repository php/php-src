=============================
1. Reserved words and classes
=============================

- **namespace** and **goto** are now reserved keywords.

- **Closure** is now a reserved class. (Used by lambda and closure.)

=====================================
2. Changes made to existing functions
=====================================

- Paths containing NULL (like /some/path\0foo.txt) are now considered invalid. 
  See http://news.php.net/php.internals/50191

- The HTTP stream wrapper now considers all status codes from 200 to 399 to be
  successful.

- The array functions natsort(), natcasesort(), usort(), uasort(), uksort(),
  array_flip(), and array_unique() no longer accept objects passed as arguments.
  If you need to use them to access an object's properties, you must cast the
  object to an array first.

- var_dump() output now includes private object members.

- session_start() now returns FALSE when the session startup fails.

- property_exists() now checks the existence of a property independent of
  accessibility (like method_exists()).

- The $initial parameter for array_reduce can now be of any type.

- clearstatcache() no longer clears the realpath cache by default.

- realpath() is no longer system-dependent and works identically on all
  platforms.

- call_user_func() now propagates $this even if the callee is the parent class.

- The filesystem functions opendir(), scandir(), and dir() now use the default
  context if no context argument is passed.

- The behaviour of functions with by-reference parameters called by value has
  changed. Where previously the function would accept the by-value argument, a
  warning is now emitted and all by-ref parameters are set to NULL.

- There is now native support for the following math functions: asinh(),
  acosh(), atanh(), log1p(), and expm1().

- In the GD extension, there is now pixelation support available through
  the imagefilter() function.

- crypt() now has Blowfish and extended DES support, and crypt() features are
  now 100% portable. PHP has its own internal crypt implementation which drops
  into place when system support for crypt or crypt_r() is not found.

- get_cfg_var() is now able to return "array" INI options.

- Stream wrappers can now be used by the include_path INI directive.

- These functions now take new parameters:
     clearstatcache(): $clear_realpath_cache and $filename.
     copy(): $context
     fgetcsv(): $escape
     ini_get_all(): $details
     json_encode(): $options
     json_decode(): $depth
     nl2br(): $is_xhtml
     parse_ini_file(): $scanner_mode
     round(): $mode
     stream_context_create(): $params
     strstr(), stristr(): $before_needle
     sybase_connect(): $new

- And new mode option for fopen: 'n' (O_NONBLOCK)

- The new mysqlnd library necessitates using MySQL's newer 41-byte password
  format. Continued use of the old 16 byte passwords will cause mysql_connect()
  and other related functions to produce the following error message:
  "mysqlnd cannot connect to MySQL 4.1+ using old authentication"

- The dl() function is now disabled by default, and only available under the
  cli, cgi, and embed SAPIs.

- mail() now supports the logging of sent mail.

- stream_select(), stream_set_blocking(), stream_set_timeout(), and 
  stream_set_write_buffer() now work with user-space stream wrappers.

- getopt() accepts "long options" now on all platforms.
  Optional values and using = as a separator for short options are now
  supported.


===================================
3. Changes made to existing methods
===================================

- The magic methods __get(), __set(), __isset(), __unset(), and __call() should
  always be public and can no longer be static. Method signatures are enforced.

- The __call() magic method is now invoked on access to private and protected
  methods.

- The __toString() magic method can no longer accept arguments.

- There is a new magic method, __callStatic().

- Internal count() vs. count_elements() handler resolution rules have changed.
  (This could potentially break custom PHP extensions.)

- The trailing / has been removed from SplFileInfo and other related directory
  classes.

- SplFileInfo::getpathinfo() now returns information about the path name.

- There are new parameters in:
     Exception::__construct(): $previous

===================================
4. Changes made to existing classes
===================================

- SplObjectStorage now has ArrayAccess support. It is also now possible to
  store associative information with objects in SplObjectStorage.
  
=====================
4.1 New in PHP 5.3.9
=====================

- Write operations within XSLT (for example with the extension sax:output) are
  disabled by default. You can define what is forbidden with the INI option
  xsl.security_prefs. This option will be marked as deprecated in 5.4 again. 
  Use the method XsltProcess::setSecurityPrefs($options) there.

- the following new directives were added

  - max_input_vars - specifies how many GET/POST/COOKIE input variables may be
    accepted. default value 1000. 

=============
5. Deprecated
=============

- define_syslog_variables() is deprecated.

- set_socket_blocking() is deprecated.

- call_user_method() and call_user_method_array() are now deprecated. Use
  call_user_func() and call_user_func_array() instead.

- The set_magic_quotes_runtime() function is now deprecated.

- mysql_listtables(), mysql_dropdb(), mysql_createdb(), mysql_list_tables(),
  mysql_drop_db(), and mysql_create_db() are now deprecated.

- All ereg functions are now deprecated and emit E_DEPRECATED errors:
  sql_regcase(), spliti(), split(), ereg_replace(), eregi(),
  ereg_replace(), and ereg().
  Use the PCRE family of functions (preg_*()) instead.

- mcrypt_generic_end() is deprecated.

- mysql_db_query() is deprecated.

- mysql_escape_string() is deprecated.

- session_register(), session_unregister(), and session_is_registered() are now
  deprecated. Use the $_SESSION superglobal array instead.

- Comments starting with '#' are now deprecated in .INI files.

- The following INI directives will now emit an E_DEPRECATED warning 
  upon startup if they are activated:

        - define_syslog_variables
        - register_globals
        - register_long_arrays
        - safe_mode
        - magic_quotes_gpc
        - magic_quotes_runtime
        - magic_quotes_sybase

- The is_dst parameter to mktime() is deprecated.

===============
6. Undeprecated
===============

- By popular request, is_a() is no longer deprecated.

==============
7. Extensions:
==============

     a. moved out to PECL and actively maintained there

        - fdf
        - ming
        - ncurses

     b. no longer maintained

        - dbase
        - fbsql
        - msql
        - sybase (use sybase_ct, which is still in PHP core)
        - mhash (hash has full BC layer)
        - mime_magic (use fileinfo, has full BC layer)

     c. with changed behaviour

        - dns: dns_check_record() will now return an extra "entries" index,
          containing the TXT elements.

        - datetime: date/time functions will no longer use the TZ environment
          variable to guess which timezone should be used.

        - cURL now supports SSH

        - hash: The SHA-224 and salsa hash algorithms are now supported.

        - mbstring: Now supports CP850 encoding.

        - oci8: Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP) and Fast Application
          Notification (FAN) are now supported.

          Oracle External Authentication is now supported (except on Windows).

          The oci8 function oci_bind_by_name() now supports SQLT_AFC (aka the
          CHAR datatype).

          Calling oci_close() on a persistent connection, or when the variable
          that references a persistent connection goes out of scope, will now
          trigger a roll back of an uncommitted transaction. To avoid unexpected
          behavior explicitly issue a commit or roll back as needed. The old
          behavior can be enabled with the INI directive
          oci8.old_oci_close_semantics.

        - openssl: OpenSSL digest and cipher functions are now supported.
          It is also now possible to access the internal values of DSA, RSA and
          DH keys.

        - session: Sessions will no longer store session-files in "/tmp" when
          open_basedir restrictions apply, unless "/tmp" is explicitly added to
          the list of allowed paths.

        - SOAP: Now supports sending user-supplied HTTP headers.

        - MySQLi: Now supports persistent connections by prepending the hostname 
          with "p:".

        - imagepstext now rejects invalid antialiasing steps and raises a warning.

     d. no longer possible to disable

        - PCRE
        - Reflection
        - SPL

==========================
8. Changes in SAPI support
==========================

- A new "litespeed" SAPI is now available.

- FastCGI is now always enabled and can not be disabled. See sapi/cgi/CHANGES
  for more details.

- A new CGI SAPI option, -T, can be used to measure execution time of a script
  repeated several times.
 
- CGI/FastCGI now has support for .htaccess style user-defined php.ini files.
  See the new user_ini.filename and user_ini.cache_ttl INI directives.

============================
9. Changes in INI directives
============================

- zend_extension_debug and zend_extension_ts have been removed. Always use the
  zend_extension directive to load Zend Extensions.

- zend.ze1_compatibility_mode has been removed. If this INI directive is set to
  on, then an E_ERROR is emitted at startup.

- There is now support for special sections: [PATH=/opt/httpd/www.example.com/]
  and [HOST=www.example.com]. Directives set in these sections cannot be
  overridden by user-defined INI files or at runtime.

- Added mbstring.http_output_conv_mimetype. This directive specifies the
  regex pattern of content types for which mb_output_handler() is activated.

- It is now possible to use the full path to load modules using the "extension"
  directive.

- "INI variables" can now be used almost anywhere in a php.ini file.

- It is now possible to use alphanumeric or variable indices in INI option
  arrays.

- open_basedir is now PHP_INI_ALL

- Runtime tightening of open_basedir restrictions is now possible.

- The default value of session.use_only_cookies has changed to "1".

- The default value of oci8.default_prefetch has been changed from 10 to 100.

- A new directive, request_order, controls the behavior of $_REQUEST
  independently of variables_order.
- A new directive, called windows.show_crt_warning, has been introduced.
  This directive shows the CRT warnings when enabled. These warnings were
  displayed by default until now. It is disabled by default.

- New INI directives: 
  - mail.add_x_header
  - user_ini.filename
  - user_ini.cache_ttl
  - exit_on_timeout
  - mysqli.allow_persistent
  - mysqli.default_host
  - mysqli.default_socket
  - mysqli.allow_local_infile
  - mysqli.cache_size
  - oci8.connection_class

====================
10. Syntax additions
====================

- NOWDOC: Similar to HEREDOC, but with single quotes:

      <<<'LABEL' ...

  Static HEREDOCs can be used to initialize static variables and class members
  or constants:

      static $foo = <<<LABEL
      No variables here...
      LABEL;

- HEREDOC now supports wrapping the identifier with double-quotes, to complement
  the NOWDOC syntax:

      <<<"LABEL" ...

- The ?: operator has been introduced:

      var_dump(0 ?: 'Hello!');

- Namespaces were added:

      namespace my\name;
      $obj = new \my\name\MyClass;

- Dynamic access to static methods is now possible:

      $foo::myFunc();

- Exceptions can now be nested:

      class MyCustomException extends Exception {}
      try {
          throw new MyCustomException("Something happend", 112);
      } catch(Exception $e) {
          throw new InvalidArgumentException("You are doing it wrong!", 911, $e);
      }

- Exceptions can now be handled in destructors.

- A garbage collector has been added and is enabled by default.

===================
11. Windows support
===================

- The minimum Windows version is now Windows 2000. (Windows 98, ME and NT4 are
  no longer supported).

- PHP Windows binaries target i586 or later. i386 and i486 are not supported.

- Support for the IIS SAPI has been dropped. Use the FastCGI SAPI instead 
  (available for IIS5 and later)). FastCGI is the recommended way to use PHP
  with IIS (see http://php.iis.net/).

- A new build is available based on the latest Visual C++ Compiler (VC9). 
  Its use is recommended with FastCGI or CLI. Apache's Windows binaries are not
  compatible with VC9; however, you can use Apache Lounge's build
  (http://apachelounge.com).

- The x64 binaries are for experimental usage only. They are not meant to be 
  used in production.

- A new site is available to download Windows releases as well as Windows-only
  releases: http://windows.php.net. Windows-specific releases will be made to
  fix security issues in the bundled libraries (libpng, openssl, etc.). Please
  note that this site does not replace the main PHP site as a source of PHP
  news, resources, or documentation.

- Windows support has been added for the following functions: getopt(),
  imagecolorclosesthwb(), mcrypt_create_iv(), inet_ntop(), inet_pton(), 
  getmxrr(), checkdnsrr(), dns_get_record(), linkinfo(), readlink(), 
  symlink(), link(), fnmatch(), stream_socket_pair(), time_nanosleep(), 
  time_sleep_until(), and socket_create_pair().

- Crypt supports now all available algorithms on Windows (blowfish included).

- Improved portability of stat(), touch(), filemtime(), filesize() and related
  functions (100% portable for the available data).

- It is now possible to create hard links on Windows using the link() function,
  and symbolic links using the symlink() function. Hard links are available
  as of Windows 2000 and symbolic links as of Windows Vista.

- The PDO_OCI php_pdo_oci8.dll library (for use with Oracle version 8 client
  libraries) is no longer being built. Instead, use php_pdo_oci.dll (note no
  '8') with Oracle 10 or 11 client libraries. Connection to other database
  versions is still supported.

- For the OCI8 extension, a new library php_oci8_11g.dll is available in
  addition to php_oci8.dll. Only one can be enabled at any time. Use
  php_oci8.dll with Oracle 10.2 client libraries. Use php_oci8_11g.dll with
  Oracle 11 client libraries. Connection to other database versions is still
  supported.

- Firebird and SNMP support are no longer available on Windows. Firebird support
  may be reintroduced in the future.

- As of PHP 5.3.15 and above the COM extension isn't compiled statically in PHP
  anymore but shared. It'll still be delivered with the standard PHP release but
  must be activated manually with the "extension = php_com_dotnet.dll" directive
  in php.ini.

- Apache 2.4 handler is supported as of PHP 5.3.20

=====================
11.1 New in PHP 5.3.4
=====================

- open_basedir supports now symbolic links (checks the target).
- is_link and SplFileInfo symbolic links related method are now fully supported
  (on Windows Vista or later).

===================
12. New in PHP 5.3:
===================

     a. New libraries

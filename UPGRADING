========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- Date:
  . DateTime::createFromImmutable() now has a tentative return type of static,
    previously it was DateTime.
  . DateTimeImmutable::createFromMutable() now has a tentative return type of static,
    previously it was DateTimeImmutable.

- ODBC:
  . The ODBC extension now escapes the username and password for the case when
    both a connection string and username/password are passed, and the string
    must be appended to. Before, user values containing values needing escaping
    could have created a malformed connection string, or injected values from
    user-provided data. The escaping rules should be identical to the .NET BCL
    DbConnectionOptions behaviour.

- PDO_ODBC:
  . The PDO_ODBC extension also escapes the username and password when a
    connection string is passed. See the change to the ODBC extension for
    further details.

- Standard:
  . strtolower() and strtoupper() are no longer locale-sensitive. They now
    perform ASCII case conversion, as if the locale were "C". Use
    mb_strtolower() if you want localized case conversion. Similarly, stristr,
    stripos, strripos, lcfirst, ucfirst, ucwords, str_ireplace,
    array_change_key_case and sorting with SORT_FLAG_CASE use ASCII case
    conversion.

- SPL:
  . The following methods now enforce their signature:
    * SplFileInfo::_bad_state_ex()
    * SplFileObject::getCsvControl()
    * SplFileObject::fflush()
    * SplFileObject::ftell()
    * SplFileObject::fgetc()
    * SplFileObject::fpassthru()
  . SplFileObject::hasChildren() now has a tentative return type of false,
    previously it was bool
  . SplFileObject::getChildren() now has a tentative return type of null,
    previously it was ?RecursiveIterator

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- Core:
  . Added the #[\SensitiveParameter] attribute to redact sensitive data in
    backtraces.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/redact_parameters_in_back_traces
  . It is now possible to use null and false as standalone types.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/null-false-standalone-types
  . Added support for readonly classes.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/readonly_classes


- Curl:
  . Added CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_METHOD option and returning the effective
    HTTP method in curl_getinfo() return value.

- OCI8:
  . Added an oci8.prefetch_lob_size directive and oci_set_prefetch_lob()
    function to tune LOB query performance by reducing the number of
    round-trips between PHP and Oracle Database when fetching LOBS. This is
    usable with Oracle Database 12.2 or later.

- ODBC:
  . Added odbc_connection_string_is_quoted, odbc_connection_string_should_quote,
    and odbc_connection_string_quote. These are primarily used behind the scenes
    in the ODBC and PDO_ODBC extensions, but is exposed to userland for easier
    unit testing, and for user applications and libraries to perform quoting
    themselves.

- PCRE:
  . Added support for the "n" (NO_AUTO_CAPTURE) modifier, which makes simple
    `(xyz)` groups non-capturing. Only named groups like `(?<name>xyz)` are
    capturing. This only affects which groups are capturing, it is still
    possible to use numbered subpattern references, and the matches array will
    still contain numbered results.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

- Core:
  . Creation of dynamic properties is deprecated, unless the class opts in by
    using the #[AllowDynamicProperties] attribute. stdClass allows dynamic
    properties. Usage of __get()/__set() is not affected by this change. A
    dynamic properties deprecation warning can be addressed by:
     - Declaring the property (preferred).
     - Adding the #[AllowDynamicProperties] attribute to the class (which also
       applies to all child classes).
     - Using a WeakMap if you wish to associate additional data with an object
       you do not own.

  . Callables that are not accepted by the $callable() syntax (but are accepted
    by call_user_func) are deprecated. In particular:

        "self::method"
        "parent::method"
        "static::method"
        ["self", "method"]
        ["parent", "method"]
        ["static", "method"]
        ["Foo", "Bar::method"]
        [new Foo, "Bar::method"]

    This does not affect normal method callables like "A::method" or
    ["A", "method"]. A deprecation notice is only emitted on call. Both
    is_callable() and the callable type will silently accept these callables
    until support for them is removed entirely.

    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_partially_supported_callables

  . The "${var}" and "${expr}" style string interpolations are deprecated and
    will be removed in PHP 9. Use "$var"/"{$var}" or "{${expr}}", respectively.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_dollar_brace_string_interpolation

- Mbstring:
  . Use of QPrint, Base64, Uuencode, and HTML-ENTITIES 'text encodings' is
    deprecated for all Mbstring functions. Unlike all the other text
    encodings supported by Mbstring, these do not encode a sequence of
    Unicode codepoints, but rather a sequence of raw bytes. It is not
    clear what the correct return values for most Mbstring functions should
    be when one of these non-encodings is specified. Further, PHP has
    separate, built-in implementations of all of them; for example, UUencoded
    data can be handled using convert_uuencode/convert_uudecode.

- SPL:
  . The SplFileInfo::_bad_state_ex() internal method has been deprecated.

- Standard:
  . utf8_encode() and utf8_decode() have been deprecated.

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

- DBA
  . dba_open() and dba_popen() now have the following enforced function signature
    dba_open(string $path, string $mode, ?string $handler = null, int $permission = 0o644, int $map_size = 0)
  . dba_fetch()'s optional skip argument is now at the end in line with
    PHP userland semantics its signature now is:
    dba_fetch(string|array $key, $dba, int $skip = 0): string|false
    The overloaded signature
    dba_fetch(string|array $key, $skip, $dba): string|false
    is still accepted, but it is recommended to use the new standard variant.

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

- Reflection:
  . ReflectionFunction::isAnonymous()
  . ReflectionMethod::hasPrototype()

- Sodium:
  . sodium_crypto_stream_xchacha20_xor_ic()

- Standard:
  . The peak memory usage can now be reset to the current usage thanks to
    memory_reset_peak_usage().

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================

========================================
8. Removed Extensions and SAPIs
========================================

========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================

- Date:
  . DatePeriod properties are now properly declared.

- Intl:
  . IntlBreakIterator, IntlRuleBasedBreakIterator, IntlCodePointBreakIterator,
    IntlPartsIterator, IntlCalendar, IntlCalendar, Collator, IntlIterator,
    UConverter, IntlDateFormatter, IntlDatePatternGenerator, MessageFormatter,
    ResourceBundle, Spoofchecker, IntlTimeZone and Transliterator instances are
    no longer serializable. Previously, they could be serialized, but
    unserialization yielded unusable objects or failed.

- mysqli:
  . The support for libmysql has been removed. It's no longer possible to compile
    mysqli with libmysql and all relevant functionality has been removed.
  . The reconnect property of mysqli_driver has been removed. It was supported only by libmysql.
  . The INI directive mysqli.reconnect has been removed.

- OCI8:
  . The minimum Oracle Client library version required is now 11.2.

- SQLite3:
  . sqlite3.defensive is now PHP_INI_USER.

- Standard:
  . getimagesize() now reports the actual image dimensions, bits and channels
    of AVIF images. Previously, the dimensions have been reported as 0x0, and
    bits and channels have not been reported at all.

- Tidy:
  . tidy properties are now properly declared.
  . tidyNode properties are now properly declared as readonly.

- Zip:
  . extension updated to 1.20.0 with new methods:
    ZipArchive::clearError, getStreamName and getStreamIndex

========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

- COM_DOTNET:
  . LOCALE_NEUTRAL

- Curl:
  . CURLOPT_XFERINFOFUNCTION
  . CURLOPT_MAXFILESIZE_LARGE

- Sockets:
  . SO_INCOMING_CPU
  . SO_MEMINFO
  . SO_RTABLE (OpenBSD)
  . TCP_KEEPALIVE (MacOS)
  . TCP_KEEPCNT (Linux, others)
  . TCP_KEEPIDLE (Linux, others)
  . TCP_KEEPINTVL (Linux, others)
  . TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT
  . LOCAL_CREDS_PERSISTENT (FreeBSD)
  . SCM_CREDS2 (FreeBSD)
  . LOCAL_CREDS (NetBSD)
  . SO_BPF_EXTENSIONS
  . SO_SETFIB

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

========================================
12. Windows Support
========================================

- Core:
  . Windows specific error messages are no longer localized, but instead in
    English to better match PHP error messages.

- OCI8:
  . Since building against Oracle Client 10g is no longer supported anyway,
    the configuration option --with-oci8 has been dropped. --with-oci8-11g,
    --with-oci8-12c and --with-oci8-19 are still supported.

- Zip:
  . The Zip extension is now built as shared library (DLL) by default.

========================================
13. Other Changes
========================================

- Core:
  . The iterable type is now a built-in compile time alias for array|Traversable.
    Error messages relating to iterable will therefore now use array|Traversable.
    Type Reflection is preserved for single iterable (and ?iterable) to produce
    a ReflectionNamedType with name iterable, however usage of iterable in
    union types will be converted to array|Traversable

========================================
14. Performance Improvements
========================================

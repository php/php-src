========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- BZ2:
  . bzcompress() now throws a ValueError when $block_size is not between
    1 and 9.
  . bzcompress() now throws a ValueError when $work_factor is not between
    0 and 250.

- Core:
  . It is no longer possible to use "array" and "callable" as class alias names
    in class_alias().
  . Loosely comparing uncomparable objects (e.g. enums, \CurlHandle and other
    internal classes) to booleans was previously inconsistent. If compared to a
    boolean literal $object == true, it would behave the same way as (bool)
    $object. If compared to a statically unknown value $object == $true, it
    would always return false. This behavior was consolidated to always follow
    the behavior of (bool) $object.
  . The return value of gc_collect_cycles() no longer includes strings and
    resources that were indirectly collected through cycles.

- Intl:
  . The extension now requires at least ICU 57.1.

- LDAP:
  . ldap_get_option() and ldap_set_option() now throw a ValueError when
    passing an invalid option.

- PCNTL:
  . pcntl_exec() now throws ValueErrors when entries of the $args parameter
    contain null bytes.
  . pcntl_exec() now throws ValueErrors when entries or keys of the
    $env_vars parameter contain null bytes.

- PDO:
  . The constructor arguments set in conjunction with PDO::FETCH_CLASS now
    follow the usual CUFA (call_user_func_array) semantics.
    This means string keys will act like a named argument.
    Moreover, automatic wrapping for by-value arguments passed to a by-ref
    parameter has been removed, and the usual E_WARNING about this is now
    emitted.
    To pass a variable by-ref to a constructor argument use the general
    array value reference assignment: $ctor_args = [&$valByRef]
  . Attempting to modify a PDOStatement during a call to PDO::fetch(),
    PDO::fetchObject(), PDO::fetchAll() will now throw an Error.

- PDO_FIREBIRD:
  . A ValueError is now thrown when trying to set a cursor name that is too
    long on a PDOStatement resulting from the Firebird driver.

- SPL:
  . ArrayObject no longer accepts enums, as modifying the $name or $value
    properties can break engine assumptions.
  . SplFileObject::fwrite's parameter $length is now nullable. The default
    value changed from 0 to null.

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- Core:
  . Closure is now a proper subtype of callable
  . Added support for Closures in constant expressions.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures_in_const_expr
  . Fatal Errors (such as an exceeded maximum execution time) now include a
    backtrace.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/error_backtraces_v2

- Curl:
  . Added support for share handles that are persisted across multiple PHP
    requests, safely allowing for more effective connection reuse.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/curl_share_persistence_improvement

- DOM:
  . Added Dom\Element::$outerHTML.

- XSL:
  . The $namespace argument of XSLTProcessor::getParameter(),
    XSLTProcessor::setParameter() and XSLTProcessor::removeParameter()
    now actually works instead of being treated as empty.
    This only works if the $name argument does not use Clark notation
    and is not a QName because in those cases the namespace is taken
    from the namespace href or prefix respectively.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

- CLI:
  . Trying to set a process title that is too long with cli_set_process_title()
    will now fail instead of silently truncating the given title.

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

- Hash:
  The MHASH_* constants have been deprecated.  These have been overlooked
  when the mhash*() function family has been deprecated per
  https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_1#mhash_function_family

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

- Intl:
  . IntlDateFormatter::setTimeZone()/datefmt_set_timezone()
    throws an IntlException on uninitialised classes/clone failures.

  . grapheme_extract() properly assigns $next value when skipping over
    invalid starting bytes. Previously there were cases where it would
    point to the start of the grapheme boundary instead of the end.

- PCNTL:
  . pcntl_exec() now has a formal return type of false.

- PDO_PGSQL:
  . PDO::pgsqlCopyFromArray also supports inputs as Iterable.
  . Pdo\Pgsql::setAttribute and Pdo\Pgsql::prepare supports
    PDO::ATTR_PREFETCH sets to 0 which set to lazy fetch mode.
    In this mode, statements cannot be run parallely.

- PGSQL:
  . pg_copy_from also supports inputs as Iterable.
  . pg_connect checks if the connection_string argument contains
    any null byte.
  . pg_close_stmt checks if the statement_name argument contains
    any null byte.

- POSIX:
  . posix_ttyname sets last_error to EBADF when encountering
    an invalid file descriptor.
  . posix_isatty raises an E_WARNING message when encountering
    an invalid file descriptor.
  . posix_fpathconf checks invalid file descriptors and sets
    last_error to EBADF and raises an E_WARNING message.

- Session:
  . session_start is stricter in regard of the option argument.
    it throws a ValueError if the whole is not a hashmap or
    a TypeError if read_on_close value is not a valid type
    compatible with int.

- SNMP:
  . snmpget, snmpset, snmp_get2, snmp_set2, snmp_get3, snmp_set3
    and SNMP::__construct() throw a ValueError when the hostname
    is too large, contains any null byte or if the port is given
    when negative or greater than 65535, timeout and retries values
    are lower than -1 or too large.

- Sockets:
  . socket_create_listen, socket_bind and socket_sendto throw a
    ValueError if the port is lower than 0 or greater than 65535,
    also if any of the hints array entry is indexes numerically.
  . socket_addrinfo_lookup throw a TypeError if any of the hints
    values cannot be cast to a int and can throw a ValueError if
    any of these values overflow.
  . socket_set_option with MCAST_LEAVE_GROUP/MCAST_LEAVE_SOURCE_GROUP
    options will throw an exception if the value isn't a valid object
    or array.
  . socket_create/socket_bind can create AF_PACKET family sockets.
  . socket_getsockname gets the interface index and its string
    representation with AF_PACKET socket.

- Zlib:
  . The "use_include_path" argument for the
    gzfile, gzopen and readgzfile functions had been changed
    from int to boolean.
  . gzfile, gzopen and readgzfile functions now respect the default
    stream context.

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

- Curl:
  . curl_multi_get_handles() allows retrieving all CurlHandles current
    attached to a CurlMultiHandle. This includes both handles added using
    curl_multi_add_handle() and handles accepted by CURLMOPT_PUSHFUNCTION.
  . curl_share_init_persistent() allows creating a share handle that is
    persisted across multiple PHP requests.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/curl_share_persistence_improvement

- DOM:
  . Added Dom\Element::insertAdjacentHTML().

- Enchant:
  . Added enchant_dict_remove_from_session() to remove a word added to the
    spellcheck session via enchant_dict_add_to_session().

- PGSQL:
  . pg_close_stmt offers an alternative way to close a prepared
    statement from the DEALLOCATE sql command in that we can reuse
    its name afterwards.

- Reflection:
  . ReflectionConstant::getFileName() was introduced.
  . ReflectionConstant::getExtension() and
    ReflectionConstant::getExtensionName() were introduced.

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================

- Curl:
  . CurlSharePersistentHandle representing a share handle that is persisted
    across multiple PHP requests.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/curl_share_persistence_improvement

========================================
8. Removed Extensions and SAPIs
========================================

========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================

- Readline:
  . The return types of readline_add_history(), readline_clear_history(), and
    readline_callback_handler_install() have been changed to true, rather
    than bool.

========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

- Core:
  . PHP_BUILD_DATE.

- POSIX:
  . POSIX_SC_OPEN_MAX.

- Sockets:
  . IPPROTO_ICMP/IPPROTO_ICMPV6.
  . TCP_FUNCTION_BLK (FreeBSD only).
  . TCP_FUNCTION_ALIAS (FreeBSD only).
  . TCP_REUSPORT_LB_NUMA (FreeBSD only).
  . TCP_REUSPORT_LB_NUMA_NODOM (FreeBSD only).
  . TCP_REUSPORT_LB_NUMA_CURDOM (FreeBSD only).
  . TCP_BBR_ALGORITHM (FreeBSD only).
  . AF_PACKET (Linux only).

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

- Core:
  . Added fatal_error_backtraces to control whether fatal errors should include
    a backtrace.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/error_backtraces_v2

- Opcache:
  . Added opcache.file_cache_read_only to support a read-only
    opcache.file_cache directory, for use with read-only file systems
    (e.g. read-only Docker containers).
    Best used with opcache.validate_timestamps=0,
    opcache.enable_file_override=1,
    and opcache.file_cache_consistency_checks=0.
    Note: A cache generated with a different build of PHP, a different file
    path, or different settings (including which extensions are loaded), may be
    ignored.

========================================
12. Windows Support
========================================

* The configuration variables PHP_VERSION, PHP_MINOR_VERSION, and
  PHP_RELEASE_VERSION are now always numbers.  Previously, they have been
  strings for buildconf builds.

* phpize builds now reflect the source tree in the build dir (like that already
  worked for in-tree builds); some extension builds (especially when using
  Makefile.frag.w32) may need adjustments.

* --enable-sanitzer is now supported for MSVC builds.  This enables ASan and
  debug assertions, and is supported as of MSVC 16.10 and Windows 10.

* The --with-uncritical-warn-choke configuration option for clang builds is
  no longer supported.  Select warnings to suppress via CFLAGS instead.

* COM:
  . The extension is now build shared by default; previously it defaulted to a
    static extension, although the official Windows binaries built a shared
    extension.

* FFI:
  . It is no longer necessary to specify the library when using FFI::cdef()
    and FFI::load(). However, this convenience feature should not be used in
    production.

* Streams:
  . If only pipe streams are contained in the $read array, and the $write and
    $except arrays are empty, stream_select() now behaves similar to POSIX
    systems, i.e. the function only returns if at least one pipe is ready to be
    read, or after the timeout expires.  Previously, stream_select() returned
    immediately, reporting all streams as ready to read.

========================================
13. Other Changes
========================================

- Core:
  The high resolution timer (`hrtime()`) on macOS now uses the recommended
  `clock_gettime_nsec_np(CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW)` API instead of
  `mach_absolute_time()`.

========================================
14. Performance Improvements
========================================

- XMLReader:
  . Improved property access performance.

- XMLWriter:
  . Improved performance and reduce memory consumption.

========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- BZ2:
  . bzcompress() now throws a ValueError when $block_size is not between
    1 and 9.
  . bzcompress() now throws a ValueError when $work_factor is not between
    0 and 250.

- Core:
  . It is no longer possible to use "array" and "callable" as class alias names
    in class_alias().
  . Loosely comparing uncomparable objects (e.g. enums, \CurlHandle and other
    internal classes) to booleans was previously inconsistent. If compared to a
    boolean literal $object == true, it would behave the same way as (bool)
    $object. If compared to a statically unknown value $object == $true, it
    would always return false. This behavior was consolidated to always follow
    the behavior of (bool) $object.
  . The return value of gc_collect_cycles() no longer includes strings and
    resources that were indirectly collected through cycles.
  . It is now allowed to substitute static with self or the concrete class name
    in final subclasses.
  . The tick handlers are now deactivated after all shutdown functions, destructors
    have run and the output handlers have been cleaned up.
    This is a consequence of fixing GH-18033.
  . Traits are now bound before the parent class. This is a subtle behavioral
    change, but should more closely match user expectations, demonstrated by
    GH-15753 and GH-16198.

- FileInfo:
  . finfo_file() and finfo::file() now throws a ValueError instead of a
    TypeError when $filename contains nul bytes.
    This aligns the type of Error thrown to be consistent with the rest of
    the language.

- Intl:
  . The extension now requires at least ICU 57.1.
  . The behaviour of Collator::SORT_REGULAR with respect to handling numeric
    strings is now aligned with the behaviour of SORT_REGULAR in ext/standard.
    This is a consequence of fixing bug GH-18566.

- LDAP:
  . ldap_get_option() and ldap_set_option() now throw a ValueError when
    passing an invalid option.

- MySQLi:
  . Calling the mysqli constructor on an already-constructed object
    is now no longer possible and throws an Error.

- PCNTL:
  . pcntl_exec() now throws ValueErrors when entries of the $args parameter
    contain null bytes.
  . pcntl_exec() now throws ValueErrors when entries or keys of the
    $env_vars parameter contain null bytes.

- PCRE:
  . The extension is compiled without semi-deprecated
    PCRE2_EXTRA_ALLOW_LOOKAROUND_BSK compile option.
    https://github.com/PCRE2Project/pcre2/issues/736#issuecomment-2754024651

- PDO:
  . The constructor arguments set in conjunction with PDO::FETCH_CLASS now
    follow the usual CUFA (call_user_func_array) semantics.
    This means string keys will act like a named argument.
    Moreover, automatic wrapping for by-value arguments passed to a by-ref
    parameter has been removed, and the usual E_WARNING about this is now
    emitted.
    To pass a variable by-ref to a constructor argument use the general
    array value reference assignment: $ctor_args = [&$valByRef]
  . Attempting to call PDOStatement::setFetchMode during a call to PDO::fetch(),
    PDO::fetchObject(), PDO::fetchAll(),
    for example using tricks such as passing the statement object as a constructor
    argument when fetching into an object, will now throw an Error.
  . The value of the constants PDO::FETCH_GROUP, PDO::FETCH_UNIQUE,
    PDO::FETCH_CLASSTYPE, PDO::FETCH_PROPS_LATE, and PDO::FETCH_SERIALIZE
    have changed.
  . A ValueError is now thrown if PDO::FETCH_PROPS_LATE is used with a fetch
    mode different than PDO::FETCH_CLASS, consistent with other fetch flags.
  . A ValueError is now thrown if PDO::FETCH_INTO is used as a fetch mode in
    PDO::fetchAll(), similar to PDO::FETCH_LAZY.

- PDO_FIREBIRD:
  . A ValueError is now thrown when trying to set a cursor name that is too
    long on a PDOStatement resulting from the Firebird driver.

- Session:
  . Attempting to write session data where $_SESSION has a key containing
    the pipe character will now emit a warning instead of silently failing.

- SimpleXML:
  . Passing an XPath expression that returns something other than a node set
    to SimpleXMLElement::xpath() will now emit a warning and return false,
    instead of silently failing and returning an empty array.

- SPL:
  . ArrayObject no longer accepts enums, as modifying the $name or $value
    properties can break engine assumptions.
  . SplFileObject::fwrite's parameter $length is now nullable. The default
    value changed from 0 to null.

- Standard:
  . Using a printf-family function with a formatter that did not specify the
    precision previously incorrectly reset the precision instead of treating
    it as a precision of 0. See GH-18897.

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- Core:
  . Closure is now a proper subtype of callable
  . Added support for Closures and first class callables in constant
    expressions.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/closures_in_const_expr
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/fcc_in_const_expr
  . Fatal Errors (such as an exceeded maximum execution time) now include a
    backtrace.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/error_backtraces_v2
  . Added the #[\NoDiscard] attribute to indicate that a function's return
    value is important and should be consumed.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_return_value_as_important
  . Added the (void) cast to indicate that not using a value is intentional.
    The (void) cast has no effect on the program's execution by itself, but
    it can be used to suppress warnings emitted by #[\NoDiscard] and possibly
    also diagnostics emitted by external IDEs or static analysis tools.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/marking_return_value_as_important
  . Added asymmetric visibility support for static properties.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/static-aviz
  . Added support for casts in constant expressions.
  . Added support for attributes on compile-time non-class constants.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes-on-constants
  . The #[\Deprecated] attribute can now be used on constants.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes-on-constants
  . Added the pipe (|>) operator.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/pipe-operator-v3
  . Constructor property promotion can now be used for final properties.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/final_promotion

- Curl:
  . Added support for share handles that are persisted across multiple PHP
    requests, safely allowing for more effective connection reuse.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/curl_share_persistence_improvement
  . Added support for CURLINFO_USED_PROXY (libcurl >= 8.7.0),
    CURLINFO_HTTPAUTH_USED, and CURLINFO_PROXYAUTH_USED
    (libcurl >= 8.12.0) to the curl_getinfo() function.
    When curl_getinfo() returns an array, the same information
    is available as "used_proxy", "httpauth_used", and "proxyauth_used"
    keys.
    CURLINFO_USED_PROXY gets zero set if no proxy was used in the
    previous transfer or a non-zero value if a proxy was used.
    CURLINFO_HTTPAUTH_USED and CURLINFO_PROXYAUTH_USED get bitmasks
    indicating the HTTP and proxy authentication methods that were
    used in the previous request. See CURLAUTH_* constants for
    possible values.
  . Added CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE Curl option, which is a safe
    replacement for CURLOPT_INFILESIZE. On certain systems,
    CURLOPT_INFILESIZE only accepts a 32-bit signed integer as the file
    size (2.0 GiB) even on 64-bit systems. CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE
    accepts the largest integer value the system can handle.
  . Added CURLFOLLOW_OBEYCODE, CURLFOLLOW_FIRSTONLY and CURLFOLLOW_ALL values for
    CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION curl_easy_setopt option.
    CURLFOLLOW_OBEYCODE to follow more strictly in regard to redirect
    if they are allowed. CURLFOLLOW_FIRSTONLY to follow only the
    first redirect thus if there is any follow up redirect, it won't go
    any further. CURLFOLLOW_ALL is equivalent to setting CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION
    to true.

- DOM:
  . Added Dom\Element::$outerHTML.
  . Added $children property to Dom\ParentNode implementations.

- EXIF:
  . Add OffsetTime* Exif tags.

- Intl:
  . Added class constants NumberFormatter::CURRENCY_ISO,
    NumberFormatter::CURRENCY_PLURAL, NumberFormatter::CASH_CURRENCY,
    and NumberFormatter::CURRENCY_STANDARD for various currency-related
    number formats.
  . Added Locale::addLikelySubtags and Locale::minimizeSubtags to
    handle likely tags on a given locale.
  . Added IntlListFormatter class to format, order, and punctuate
    a list of items with a given locale, IntlListFormatter::TYPE_AND,
    IntlListFormatter::TYPE_OR, IntlListFormatter::TYPE_UNITS operands and
    IntlListFormatter::WIDTH_WIDE, IntlListFormatter::WIDTH_SHORT and
    IntlListFormatter::WIDTH_NARROW widths.
    It is supported from icu 67.

- PDO_Sqlite:
  . Added class constant Pdo_Sqlite::ATTR_BUSY_STATEMENT.
  . Added class constants Pdo_Sqlite::ATTR_EXPLAIN_STATEMENT,
    Pdo_Sqlite::EXPLAIN_MODE_PREPARED, Pdo_Sqlite::EXPLAIN_MODE_EXPLAIN,
    Pdo_Sqlite::EXPLAIN_MODE_EXPLAIN_QUERY_PLAN.

- SOAP:
  . Enumeration cases are now dumped in __getTypes().
  . Implemented request #61105:
    support for Soap 1.2 Reason Text xml:lang attribute.
    The signature of SoapFault::__construct() and SoapServer::fault() therefore
    now have an optional $lang parameter.
    This support solves compatibility with .NET SOAP clients.

- Sqlite:
  . Added class constants Sqlite3Stmt::EXPLAIN_MODE_PREPARED,
    Sqlite3Stmt::EXPLAIN_MODE_EXPLAIN and
    Sqlite3Stmt::EXPLAIN_MODE_EXPLAIN_QUERY_PLAN.

- Standard:
  . mail() now returns the actual sendmail error and detects if the sendmail
    process was terminated unexpectedly. In such cases, a warning is emitted
    and the function returns false. Previously, these errors were silently
    ignored. This change affects only the sendmail transport.

- XSL:
  . The $namespace argument of XSLTProcessor::getParameter(),
    XSLTProcessor::setParameter() and XSLTProcessor::removeParameter()
    now actually works instead of being treated as empty.
    This only works if the $name argument does not use Clark notation
    and is not a QName because in those cases the namespace is taken
    from the namespace href or prefix respectively.

- Zlib:
  . flock() is now supported on zlib streams. Previously, this always
    failed to perform any locking action.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

- CLI:
  . Trying to set a process title that is too long with cli_set_process_title()
    will now fail instead of silently truncating the given title.
  . Added a new --ini=diff option to print INI settings changed from the builtin
    default.

- FPM:
  . FPM with httpd ProxyPass decodes the full script path. Added
    fastcgi.script_path_encoded INI setting to prevent this new behavior.

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

- Core:
  . Returning a non-string from a user output handler is deprecated. The
    deprecation warning will bypass the handler with the bad return to ensure
    it is visible; if there are nested output handlers the next one will still
    be used.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_4

- Hash:
  . The MHASH_* constants have been deprecated.  These have been overlooked
    when the mhash*() function family has been deprecated per
    https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecations_php_8_1#mhash_function_family

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

- Intl:
  . IntlDateFormatter::setTimeZone()/datefmt_set_timezone()
    throws an IntlException on uninitialised classes/clone failures.
  . grapheme_extract() properly assigns $next value when skipping over
    invalid starting bytes. Previously there were cases where it would
    point to the start of the grapheme boundary instead of the end.
  . Locale:: methods throw a ValueError when locale inputs contain null
    bytes.
  . transliterator_get_error_code(), transliterator_get_error_message()
    TransLiterator::getErrorCode(), and TransLiterator::getErrorMessage()
    have dropped the false from the return type union. Returning false
    was actually never possible.

- LDAP:
  . ldap_get_option() now accepts a NULL connection, as ldap_set_option(),
    to allow retrieval of global options.

- libxml:
  . libxml_set_external_entity_loader() now has a formal return type of true.

- PCNTL:
  . pcntl_exec() now has a formal return type of false.
  . pcntl_waitid() takes an additional resource_usage argument to
    gather various platform specific metrics about the child process.

- PDO_PGSQL:
  . PDO::pgsqlCopyFromArray also supports inputs as Iterable.
  . Pdo\Pgsql::setAttribute and Pdo\Pgsql::prepare supports
    PDO::ATTR_PREFETCH sets to 0 which set to lazy fetch mode.
    In this mode, statements cannot be run in parallel.

- PDO_SQLITE:
  . SQLite PDO::quote() will now throw an exception or emit a warning,
    depending on the error mode, if the string contains a null byte.
  . PDO::sqliteCreateCollation will now throw an exception
    if the callback has the wrong return type, making it more
    in line with Pdo_Sqlite::createCollation behavior.

- PGSQL:
  . pg_copy_from also supports inputs as Iterable.
  . pg_connect checks if the connection_string argument contains
    any null byte.
  . pg_close_stmt checks if the statement_name argument contains
    any null byte.

- POSIX:
  . posix_ttyname sets last_error to EBADF when encountering
    an invalid file descriptor.
  . posix_isatty raises an E_WARNING message when encountering
    an invalid file descriptor.
  . posix_fpathconf checks invalid file descriptors and sets
    last_error to EBADF and raises an E_WARNING message.

- Reflection:
  . The output of ReflectionClass::toString() for enums has changed to
    better indicate that the class is an enum, and that the enum cases
    are enum cases rather than normal class constants.

- Session:
  . session_start is stricter in regard to the option argument.
    It throws a ValueError if the whole is not a hashmap or
    a TypeError if read_on_close value is not a valid type
    compatible with int.

- SNMP:
  . snmpget, snmpset, snmp_get2, snmp_set2, snmp_get3, snmp_set3
    and SNMP::__construct() throw a ValueError when the hostname
    is too large, contains any null byte or if the port is given
    when negative or greater than 65535, timeout and retries values
    are lower than -1 or too large.

- Sockets:
  . socket_create_listen, socket_bind and socket_sendto throw a
    ValueError if the port is lower than 0 or greater than 65535,
    also if any of the hints array entry is indexes numerically.
  . socket_addrinfo_lookup throws a TypeError if any of the hints
    values cannot be cast to int and can throw a ValueError if
    any of these values overflow.
  . socket_set_option with MCAST_LEAVE_GROUP/MCAST_LEAVE_SOURCE_GROUP
    options will throw an exception if the value isn't a valid object
    or array.
  . socket_create/socket_bind can create AF_PACKET family sockets.
  . socket_getsockname gets the interface index and its string
    representation with AF_PACKET socket.

- Tidy:
  . tidy::__construct/parseFile/parseString now throws a ValueError
    if the configuration contains an invalid or set a read-only
    internal entry, a TypeError contains, at least, one element
    when the key is not a string.

- Zlib:
  . The "use_include_path" argument for the
    gzfile, gzopen and readgzfile functions had been changed
    from int to boolean.
  . gzfile, gzopen and readgzfile functions now respect the default
    stream context.

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

- Core:
  . get_error_handler() allows retrieving the current user-defined error handler
    function.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/get-error-exception-handler
  . get_exception_handler() allows retrieving the current user-defined exception
    handler function.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/get-error-exception-handler
  . The clone language construct is now a function.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/clone_with_v2

- Curl:
  . curl_multi_get_handles() allows retrieving all CurlHandles current
    attached to a CurlMultiHandle. This includes both handles added using
    curl_multi_add_handle() and handles accepted by CURLMOPT_PUSHFUNCTION.
  . curl_share_init_persistent() allows creating a share handle that is
    persisted across multiple PHP requests.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/curl_share_persistence_improvement

- DOM:
  . Added Dom\Element::insertAdjacentHTML().

- Enchant:
  . Added enchant_dict_remove_from_session() to remove a word added to the
    spellcheck session via enchant_dict_add_to_session().
  . Added enchant_dict_remove() to put a word on the exclusion list and
    remove it from the session dictionary.

- Intl:
  . Added locale_is_right_to_left/Locale::isRightToLeft, returns true if
    the locale is written right to left (after its enrichment with likely subtags).
  . Added grapheme_levenshtein() function.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/grapheme_levenshtein

- Pdo\Sqlite:
  . Added support for Pdo\Sqlite::setAuthorizer(), which is the equivalent of
    SQLite3::setAuthorizer(). The only interface difference is that the
    pdo version returns void.

- PGSQL:
  . pg_close_stmt offers an alternative way to close a prepared
    statement from the DEALLOCATE sql command in that we can reuse
    its name afterwards.
  . pg_service returns the ongoing service name of the connection.

- Reflection:
  . ReflectionConstant::getFileName() was introduced.
  . ReflectionConstant::getExtension() and
    ReflectionConstant::getExtensionName() were introduced.
  . ReflectionConstant::getAttributes() was introduced.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/attributes-on-constants

- Sqlite:
  . Sqlite3Stmt::busy to check if a statement had been fetched
    but not completely.

- Standard:
  . Added array_first() and array_last().
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/array_first_last

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================

- Curl:
  . CurlSharePersistentHandle representing a share handle that is persisted
    across multiple PHP requests.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/curl_share_persistence_improvement

========================================
8. Removed Extensions and SAPIs
========================================

========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================

- Curl:
  . curl_easy_setopt with CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION option's value no longer
    is treated as boolean but integer to handle CURLFOLLOW_OBEYCODE and
    CURLFOLLOW_FIRSTONLY.

- Fileinfo:
  . Upgraded to file 5.46.
  . The return type of finfo_close() has been changed to true, rather
    than bool.

- Lexbor:
  . An always enabled lexbor extension is added. It contains the lexbor
    library that was separated from ext/dom for being reused among other
    extensions. The new extension is not directly exposed to userland.

- PCRE:
  . Upgraded to pcre2lib from 10.44 to 10.45.

- PDO_Sqlite:
  . Increased minimum release version support from 3.7.7 to 3.7.17.

- Readline:
  . The return types of readline_add_history(), readline_clear_history(), and
    readline_callback_handler_install() have been changed to true, rather
    than bool.

========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

- Core:
  . PHP_BUILD_DATE.

- Curl:
  . CURLINFO_USED_PROXY.
  . CURLINFO_HTTPAUTH_USED.
  . CURLINFO_PROXYAUTH_USED.
  . CURLOPT_INFILESIZE_LARGE.
  . CURLFOLLOW_ALL.
  . CURLFOLLOW_OBEYCODE.
  . CURLFOLLOW_FIRSTONLY.

- Intl:
  . DECIMAL_COMPACT_SHORT.
  . DECIMAL_COMPACT_LONG.

- POSIX:
  . POSIX_SC_OPEN_MAX.

- Sockets:
  . IPPROTO_ICMP/IPPROTO_ICMPV6.
  . TCP_FUNCTION_BLK (FreeBSD only).
  . TCP_FUNCTION_ALIAS (FreeBSD only).
  . TCP_REUSPORT_LB_NUMA (FreeBSD only).
  . TCP_REUSPORT_LB_NUMA_NODOM (FreeBSD only).
  . TCP_REUSPORT_LB_NUMA_CURDOM (FreeBSD only).
  . TCP_BBR_ALGORITHM (FreeBSD only).
  . AF_PACKET (Linux only).
  . IP_BINDANY (FreeBSD/NetBSD/OpenBSD only).
  . SO_BUSY_POLL (Linux only).
  . UDP_SEGMENT (Linux only).
  - SHUT_RD.
  - SHUT_WR.
  - SHUT_RDWR.

- Tokenizer:
  . T_VOID_CAST.
  . T_PIPE.

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

- Core:
  . Added fatal_error_backtraces to control whether fatal errors should include
    a backtrace.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/error_backtraces_v2

- Opcache:
  . Added opcache.file_cache_read_only to support a read-only
    opcache.file_cache directory, for use with read-only file systems
    (e.g. read-only Docker containers).
    Best used with opcache.validate_timestamps=0,
    opcache.enable_file_override=1,
    and opcache.file_cache_consistency_checks=0.
    Note: A cache generated with a different build of PHP, a different file
    path, or different settings (including which extensions are loaded), may be
    ignored.
  . The default value of opcache.jit_hot_loop is now 61 (a prime) to prevent it
    from being a multiple of loop iteration counts.
    It is recommended that this parameter is set to a prime number.

========================================
12. Windows Support
========================================

* The configuration variables PHP_VERSION, PHP_MINOR_VERSION, and
  PHP_RELEASE_VERSION are now always numbers.  Previously, they have been
  strings for buildconf builds.

* phpize builds now reflect the source tree in the build dir (like that already
  worked for in-tree builds); some extension builds (especially when using
  Makefile.frag.w32) may need adjustments.

* --enable-sanitizer is now supported for MSVC builds.  This enables ASan and
  debug assertions, and is supported as of MSVC 16.10 and Windows 10.

* The --with-uncritical-warn-choke configuration option for clang builds is
  no longer supported.  Select warnings to suppress via CFLAGS instead.

* COM:
  . The extension is now build shared by default; previously it defaulted to a
    static extension, although the official Windows binaries built a shared
    extension.

* FFI:
  . It is no longer necessary to specify the library when using FFI::cdef()
    and FFI::load(). However, this convenience feature should not be used in
    production.

* Streams:
  . If only pipe streams are contained in the $read array, and the $write and
    $except arrays are empty, stream_select() now behaves similar to POSIX
    systems, i.e. the function only returns if at least one pipe is ready to be
    read, or after the timeout expires.  Previously, stream_select() returned
    immediately, reporting all streams as ready to read.

========================================
13. Other Changes
========================================

- Core:
  . The high resolution timer (`hrtime()`) on macOS now uses the recommended
    `clock_gettime_nsec_np(CLOCK_UPTIME_RAW)` API instead of
    `mach_absolute_time()`.

- CLI/CGI:
  . The `-z` or `--zend-extension` option has been removed as it was
    non-functional. Use `-d zend_extension=<path>` instead.

========================================
14. Performance Improvements
========================================

- Core:
  . Remove OPcodes for identity comparisons against booleans, particularly
    for the match(true) pattern.
  . Add OPcode specialization for `=== []` and `!== []` comparisons.
  . Creating exception objects is now much faster.
  . The parts of the code that used SSE2 have been adapted to use SIMD
    with ARM NEON as well.

- Intl:
  . Now avoids creating extra string copies when converting strings
    for use in the collator.

- MBString:
  . The parts of the code that used SSE2 have been adapted to use SIMD
    with ARM NEON as well.

- ReflectionProperty:
  . Improved performance of the following methods: getValue(), getRawValue(),
    isInitialized(), setValue(), setRawValue().

- SPL:
  . Improved performance of dimension accessors and methods of SplFixedArray.

- Standard:
  . Improved performance of array functions with callbacks
    (array_find, array_filter, array_map, usort, ...).
  . Improved performance of urlencode() and rawurlencode().
  . Improved unpack() performance with nameless repetitions by avoiding
    creating temporary strings and reparsing them.
  . Improved pack() performance.

- XMLReader:
  . Improved property access performance.

- XMLWriter:
  . Improved performance and reduce memory consumption.

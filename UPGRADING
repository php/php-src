========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- Curl:
  . Added CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_METHOD option and returning the effective
    HTTP method in curl_getinfo() return value.

- PCRE:
  . Added support for the "n" (NO_AUTO_CAPTURE) modifier, which makes simple
    `(xyz)` groups non-capturing. Only named groups like `(?<name>xyz)` are
    capturing. This only affects which groups are capturing, it is still
    possible to use numbered subpattern references, and the matches array will
    still contain numbered results.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

- Core:
  . Callables that are not accepted by the $callable() syntax (but are accepted
    by call_user_func) are deprecated. In particular:

        "self::method"
        "parent::method"
        "static::method"
        ["self", "method"]
        ["parent", "method"]
        ["static", "method"]
        ["Foo", "Bar::method"]
        [new Foo, "Bar::method"]

    This does not affect normal method callables like "A::method" or
    ["A", "method"]. A deprecation notice is only emitted on call. Both
    is_callable() and the callable type will silently accept these callables
    until support for them is removed entirely.

    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_partially_supported_callables

- Mbstring:
  . Use of QPrint, Base64, Uuencode, and HTML-ENTITIES 'text encodings' is
    deprecated for all Mbstring functions. Unlike all the other text
    encodings supported by Mbstring, these do not encode a sequence of
    Unicode codepoints, but rather a sequence of raw bytes. It is not
    clear what the correct return values for most Mbstring functions should
    be when one of these non-encodings is specified. Further, PHP has
    separate, built-in implementations of all of them; for example, UUencoded
    data can be handled using convert_uuencode/convert_uudecode.

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

- DBA
  . dba_open() and dba_popen() now have the following enforced function signature
    dba_open(string $path, string $mode, ?string $handler = null, int $permission = 0o644, int $map_size = 0)
  . dba_fetch()'s optional skip argument is now at the end in line with
    PHP userland semantics its signature now is:
    dba_fetch(string|array $key, $dba, int $skip = 0): string|false
    The overloaded signature
    dba_fetch(string|array $key, $skip, $dba): string|false
    is still accepted, but it is recommended to use the new standard variant.

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================

========================================
8. Removed Extensions and SAPIs
========================================

========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================

- Zip:
  . extension updated to 1.20.0 with new methods:
    ZipArchive::clearError, getStreamName and getStreamIndex

========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

- COM_DOTNET:
  . LOCALE_NEUTRAL

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

========================================
12. Windows Support
========================================

- Core:
  . Windows specific error messages are no longer localized, but instead in
    English to better match PHP error messages.

========================================
13. Other Changes
========================================

========================================
14. Performance Improvements

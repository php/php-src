========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- Core:
  . Access to the $GLOBALS array is now subject to a number of restrictions.
    Read and write access to individual array elements like $GLOBALS['var']
    continues to work as-is. Read-only access to the entire $GLOBALS array also
    continues to be supported. However, write access to the entire $GLOBALS
    array is no longer supported. For example, array_pop($GLOBALS) will result
    in an error.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/restrict_globals_usage
  . Passing null to a non-nullable argument of a built-in function is
    deprecated. This matches the behavior of user-defined functions, where null
    is never accepted by non-nullable arguments.
    user-defined functions.

        var_dump(str_contains("foobar", null));
        // Deprecated: Passing null to parameter #2 ($needle) of type string
        //             is deprecated

    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_null_to_scalar_internal_arg
  . When a method using static variables is inherited, the inherited method
    will now initialize the static variables to their original values, rather
    than the values at the time of inheritance:

        class A {
            public function counter() {
                static $counter = 0;
                $counter++;
                return $counter;
            }
        }

        var_dump((new A)->counter()); // int(1)

        eval('class B extends A {}'); // eval() to prevent early binding.

        var_dump((new B)->counter()); // int(1), previously int(2)
        var_dump((new A)->counter()); // int(2)
        var_dump((new B)->counter()); // int(2), previously int(3)

    Previously the behavior would be different depending on whether A::counter()
    was called before class B was declared, or after it was declared.

- Fileinfo:
  . The fileinfo functions now accept and return, respectively, finfo objects
    instead of resources.

- IMAP:
  . The IMAP functions now accept and return, respectively, IMAPConnection objects
    instead of resources.

- MySQLi:
  . mysqli_fetch_fields() and mysqli_fetch_field_direct() will now always return
    zero for max_length. You can compute this information by iterating over the
    result set and taking the maximum length. This is what PHP was doing
    internally previously.
  . The MYSQLI_STMT_ATTR_UPDATE_MAX_LENGTH option no longer has an effect.
  . The MYSQLI_STORE_RESULT_COPY_DATA option no longer has an effect.

- MySQLnd:
  . The mysqlnd.fetch_copy_data ini setting has been removed. However, this
    should not result in user-visible behavior changes.

- PDO:
  . PDO::ATTR_STRINGIFY_FETCHES now also stringifies values of type bool to
    "0" or "1". Previously booleans were not stringified.
  . Calling bindColumn() with PDO::PARAM_LOB (and assuming stringification is
    not enabled) will now consistently bind a stream result, as documented.
    Previously the result would be either a stream or a string depending on the
    used database driver and the time the binding is performed.

- PDO MySQL:
  . Integers and floats in result sets will now be returned using native PHP
    types instead of strings when using emulated prepared statements. This
    matches the behavior of native prepared statements. You can restore the
    previous behavior by enabling the PDO::ATTR_STRINGIFY_FETCHES option.

- PDO SQLite:
  . Integers and floats in results sets will now be returned using native PHP
    types. You can restore the previous behavior by enabling the
    PDO::ATTR_STRINGFIY_FETCHES option.

- Standard:
  . version_compare() no longer accepts undocumented operator abbreviations.
  . htmlspecialchars(), htmlentities(), htmlspecialchars_decode(),
    html_entitity_decode() and get_html_translation_table() now use
    ENT_QUOTES | ENT_SUBSTITUTE rather than ENT_COMPAT by default. This means
    that ' is escaped to &#039; while previously it was left alone.
    Additionally, malformed UTF-8 will be replaced by a Unicode substitution
    character, instead of resulting in an empty string.

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- Core:
  . It is now possible to specify octal integer by using the explicit "0o"/"0O"
    prefix similar to hexadecimal ("0x"/"0X) and binary ("0b"/"0B") integer
    literals.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/explicit_octal_notation
  . Added support for array unpacking with strings keys.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/array_unpacking_string_keys

- Curl:
  . Added CURLOPT_DOH_URL option.
  . Added CURLStringFile, which can be used to post a file from a string rather
    than a file:

        $file = new CURLStringFile($data, 'filename.txt', 'text/plain');
        curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, ['file' => $file]);

- hash:
  . The following functions have changed signatures:

    - function hash(string $algo, string $data, bool $binary = false, array $options = []): string|false {}
    - function hash_file(string $algo, string $filename, bool $binary = false, array $options = []): string|false {}
    - function hash_init(string $algo, int $flags = 0, string $key = "", array $options = []): HashContext {}

    The additional `$options` argument can be used to pass algorithm specific data.

  . Added MurmurHash3 with streaming support. The following variants are implemented:

    - murmur3a, 32-bit hash
    - murmur3c, 128-bit hash for x86
    - murmur3f, 128-bit hash for x64

    The initial hash state can be passed through the `seed` key in the `$options` array, for example:

    ```php
    $h = hash("murmur3f", $data, options: ["seed" => 42]);
    echo $h, "\n";
    ```

    A valid seed value is within the range from 0 to the plaform defined UINT_MAX, usually 4294967295.

  . Added xxHash. The implementation brings in the following arguments

    - xxh32, 32-bit hash
    - xxh64, 64-bit hash
    - xxh3, 64-bit hash
    - xxh128, 128-bit hash

    The initial hash state can be passed through the `seed` key in the `$options` array, for example:

    ```php
    $h = hash("xxh3", $data, options: ["seed" => 42]);
    echo $h, "\n";
    ```

    Secret usage is supported through passing the `secret` key in the `$options` array, too:

    ```php
    $h = hash("xxh3", $data, options: ["secret" => "at least 136 bytes long secret here"]);
    echo $h, "\n";
    ```

    Note, that the quality of the custom secret is crucial for the quality of the resulting hash. It is
    highly recommended for the secret to use the best possible entropy.

- MySQLi:
  . The mysqli.local_infile_directory ini setting has been added, which can be
    used to specify a directory from which files are allowed to be loaded. It
    is only meaningful if mysqli.allow_local_infile is not enabled, as all
    directories are allowed in that case.

- PDO MySQL:
  . The PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_LOCAL_INFILE_DIRECTORY attribute has been added, which
    can be used to specify a directory from which files are allowed to be
    loaded. It is only meaningful if PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_LOCAL_INFILE is not
    enabled, as all directories are allowed in that case.

- PDO SQLite:
  . SQLite's "file:" DSN syntax is now supported, which allows specifying
    additional flags. This feature is not available if open_basedir is set.
    Example:

        new PDO('sqlite:file:path/to/sqlite.db?mode=ro')

- Posix:
  . Added POSIX_RLIMIT_KQUEUES and POSIX_RLIMIT_NPTS. These rlimits are only
    available on FreeBSD.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

- Filter:
  . The FILTER_FLAG_ALLOW_OCTAL flag of the FILTER_VALIDATE_INT filter now accept
    octal string with the leading octal prefix ("0o"/"0O")
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/explicit_octal_notation

- GMP:
  . All GMP function now accept octal string with the leading octal prefix ("0o"/"0O")
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/explicit_octal_notation

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

- Core:
  . Added array_is_list(array $array), which will return true if the array keys are 0 .. count($array)-1 in that order.
    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/is_list

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================

========================================
8. Removed Extensions and SAPIs
========================================

========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================

- MySQLi:
  . The mysqli_stmt::next_result() and mysqli::fetch_all() methods are now
    available when linking against libmysqlclient.

- OpenSSL:
  . The OpenSSL extension now requires at least OpenSSL version 1.0.2.

- Standard:
  . --with-password-argon2 now uses pkg-config to detect libargon2. As such,
    an alternative libargon2 location should now be specified using
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH.

========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

- MySQLi:
  . MYSQLI_REFRESH_REPLICA has been added as a replacement for
    MYSQLI_REFRESH_SLAVE, in line with an upstream change in MySQL. The old
    constant is still available for backwards-compatibility reasons, but may
    be deprecated/removed in the future.

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

========================================
12. Windows Support
========================================

. The macro IGNORE_URL_WIN has been removed; it had no effect as of PHP 5.0.0.

========================================
13. Other Changes
========================================

========================================
14. Performance Improvements
========================================

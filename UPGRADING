========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- DOM:
  . New methods and constants were added to some DOM classes. If you inherit
    from these and you happen to have a method or property with the same name,
    you might encounter errors if the declaration is incompatible.
    Consult sections 2. New Features and 6. New Functions for a list of
    newly implemented methods and constants.

- SimpleXML:
  . Get methods called, or casting to a string on a SimpleXMLElement will no
    longer implicitly reset the iterator data, unless explicitly rewound.
    For example, casting an element to a string within a foreach loop would
    cause an infinite loop because it destroyed the current iterator data.
    This is no longer the case as a consequence of the bugfixes for GH-12192,
    GH-12208, #55098.

- Standard:
  . round() now validates the value of the $mode parameter and throws a ValueError
    for invalid modes. Previously invalid modes would have been interpreted as
    PHP_ROUND_HALF_UP.

- XSL:
  . XSLTProcessor::setParameter() will now throw a ValueError when its arguments
    contain null bytes. This never actually worked correctly in the first place,
    which is why it throws an exception nowadays.

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- DOM:
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_DISCONNECTED.
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING.
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING.
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINS.
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINED_BY.
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC.

- XSL:
  . It is now possible to use parameters that contain both single and double
    quotes.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

- Standard:
  . The internal implementation for rounding to integers has been rewritten
    to be easier to verify for correctness and to be easier to maintain.
    Some rounding bugs have been fixed as a result of the rewrite. For
    example previously rounding 0.49999999999999994 to the nearest integer
    would have resulted in 1.0 instead of the correct result 0.0. Additional
    inputs might also be affected and result in different outputs compared to
    earlier PHP versions.
  . The default value of the 'cost' option for PASSWORD_BCRYPT for password_hash()
    has been increased from '10' to '12'.

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

- DOM:
  . Added DOMNode::compareDocumentPosition().

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================

========================================
8. Removed Extensions and SAPIs
========================================

========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================

========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

- Intl:
  . The IntlDateFormatter class exposes now the new PATTERN constant
    reflecting udat api's UDAT_PATTERN.

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

========================================
12. Windows Support
========================================

========================================
13. Other Changes
========================================

========================================
14. Performance Improvements
========================================

* The performance of DOMNode::C14N() is greatly improved for the case without
  an xpath query. This can give a time improvement of easily two order of
  magnitude for documents with tens of thousands of nodes.

========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- Standard:
  . strtolower() and strtoupper() are no longer locale-sensitive. They now
    perform ASCII case conversion, as if the locale were "C". Use
    mb_strtolower() if you want localized case conversion. Similarly, stristr,
    stripos, strripos, lcfirst, ucfirst, ucwords, str_ireplace,
    array_change_key_case and sorting with SORT_FLAG_CASE use ASCII case
    conversion.

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- Curl:
  . Added CURLINFO_EFFECTIVE_METHOD option and returning the effective
    HTTP method in curl_getinfo() return value.

- OCI8:
  . Added an oci8.prefetch_lob_size directive and oci_set_prefetch_lob()
    function to tune LOB query performance by reducing the number of
    round-trips between PHP and Oracle Database when fetching LOBS. This is
    usable with Oracle Database 12.2 or later.

- PCRE:
  . Added support for the "n" (NO_AUTO_CAPTURE) modifier, which makes simple
    `(xyz)` groups non-capturing. Only named groups like `(?<name>xyz)` are
    capturing. This only affects which groups are capturing, it is still
    possible to use numbered subpattern references, and the matches array will
    still contain numbered results.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

- Core:
  . Creation of dynamic properties is deprecated, unless the class opts in by
    using the #[AllowDynamicProperties] attribute. stdClass allows dynamic
    properties. Usage of __get()/__set() is not affected by this change. A
    dynamic properties deprecation warning can be addressed by:
     - Declaring the property (preferred).
     - Adding the #[AllowDynamicProperties] attribute to the class (which also
       applies to all child classes).
     - Using a WeakMap if you wish to associate additional data with an object
       you do not own.

  . Callables that are not accepted by the $callable() syntax (but are accepted
    by call_user_func) are deprecated. In particular:

        "self::method"
        "parent::method"
        "static::method"
        ["self", "method"]
        ["parent", "method"]
        ["static", "method"]
        ["Foo", "Bar::method"]
        [new Foo, "Bar::method"]

    This does not affect normal method callables like "A::method" or
    ["A", "method"]. A deprecation notice is only emitted on call. Both
    is_callable() and the callable type will silently accept these callables
    until support for them is removed entirely.

    RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/deprecate_partially_supported_callables

- Mbstring:
  . Use of QPrint, Base64, Uuencode, and HTML-ENTITIES 'text encodings' is
    deprecated for all Mbstring functions. Unlike all the other text
    encodings supported by Mbstring, these do not encode a sequence of
    Unicode codepoints, but rather a sequence of raw bytes. It is not
    clear what the correct return values for most Mbstring functions should
    be when one of these non-encodings is specified. Further, PHP has
    separate, built-in implementations of all of them; for example, UUencoded
    data can be handled using convert_uuencode/convert_uudecode.

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

- DBA
  . dba_open() and dba_popen() now have the following enforced function signature
    dba_open(string $path, string $mode, ?string $handler = null, int $permission = 0o644, int $map_size = 0)
  . dba_fetch()'s optional skip argument is now at the end in line with
    PHP userland semantics its signature now is:
    dba_fetch(string|array $key, $dba, int $skip = 0): string|false
    The overloaded signature
    dba_fetch(string|array $key, $skip, $dba): string|false
    is still accepted, but it is recommended to use the new standard variant.

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

- Standard:
  . The peak memory usage can now be reset to the current usage thanks to
    memory_reset_peak_usage().

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================

========================================
8. Removed Extensions and SAPIs
========================================

========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================

- Intl:
  . IntlBreakIterator, IntlRuleBasedBreakIterator, IntlCodePointBreakIterator,
    IntlPartsIterator, IntlCalendar, IntlCalendar, Collator, IntlIterator,
    UConverter, IntlDateFormatter, IntlDatePatternGenerator, MessageFormatter,
    ResourceBundle, Spoofchecker, IntlTimeZone and Transliterator instances are
    no longer serializable. Previously, they could be serialized, but
    unserialization yielded unusable objects or failed.

- OCI8:
  . The minimum Oracle Client library version required is now 11.2.

- Standard:
  . getimagesize() now reports the actual image dimensions, bits and channels
    of AVIF images. Previously, the dimensions have been reported as 0x0, and
    bits and channels have not been reported at all.

- Zip:
  . extension updated to 1.20.0 with new methods:
    ZipArchive::clearError, getStreamName and getStreamIndex

========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

- COM_DOTNET:
  . LOCALE_NEUTRAL

- Sockets:
  . SO_INCOMING_CPU

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

========================================
12. Windows Support
========================================

- Core:
  . Windows specific error messages are no longer localized, but instead in
    English to better match PHP error messages.

- OCI8:
  . Since building against Oracle Client 10g is no longer supported anyway,
    the configuration option --with-oci8 has been dropped. --with-oci8-11g,
    --with-oci8-12c and --with-oci8-19 are still supported.

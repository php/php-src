========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- DOM:
  . New methods and constants were added to some DOM classes. If you inherit
    from these and you happen to have a method or property with the same name,
    you might encounter errors if the declaration is incompatible.
    Consult sections 2. New Features and 6. New Functions for a list of
    newly implemented methods and constants.

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- DOM:
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_DISCONNECTED.
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_PRECEDING.
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_FOLLOWING.
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINS.
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_CONTAINED_BY.
  . Added constant DOMNode::DOCUMENT_POSITION_IMPLEMENTATION_SPECIFIC.

3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================

========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

- Standard:
  . The internal implementation for rounding to integers has been rewritten
    to be easier to verify for correctness and to be easier to maintain.
    Some rounding bugs have been fixed as a result of the rewrite. For
    example previously rounding 0.49999999999999994 to the nearest integer
    would have resulted in 1.0 instead of the correct result 0.0. Additional
    inputs might also be affected and result in different outputs compared to
    earlier PHP versions.

========================================
6. New Functions
========================================

- DOM:
  . Added DOMNode::compareDocumentPosition().

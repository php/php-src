========================================
1. Backward Incompatible Changes
========================================

- Core
  . list() now always supports ArrayAccess and never supports strings.
    Previously both were accepted in some situations and not in others.
    (RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/fix_list_behavior_inconsistency)
  . Bitwise shifts by negative numbers of bits are disallowed (throws E_WARNING
    and gives FALSE, like a division by zero).
  . Left bitwise shifts by a number of bits beyond the bit width of an integer
    will always result in 0, even on CPUs which wrap around.
  . Right bitwise shifts by a number of bits beyond the bit width of an integer
    will always result in 0 or -1 (depending on sign), even on CPUs which wrap
    around.
  . Removed ASP (<%) and script (<script language=php>) tags.
    (RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_alternative_php_tags)
  . call_user_method() and call_user_method_array() no longer exists.
  . PHP 7 doesn't keep original values of arguments passed to user functions,
    so func_get_arg() and func_get_args() will return current value of argument
    instead of the actually passed. The following code is going to be affected:
    function foo($x) { $x = 2; return func_get_arg(0);} var_dump(foo(1));
    It will now produce 2, not 1.
  . Function parameters with duplicate name are not allowed anymore. Definitions
    like “function foo($x,$x) {}” will lead to compile time error.
  . Indirect variable, property and method references are now interpreted with
    left-to-right semantics. See details in:
	https://wiki.php.net/rfc/uniform_variable_syntax#semantic_differences_in_existing_syntax 
  . The global keyword now only accepts simple variables. See details in:
    https://wiki.php.net/rfc/uniform_variable_syntax#global_keyword_takes_only_simple_variables
  . The addition of Unicode Codepoint Escape Syntax for double-quoted strings
    and heredocs means that \u{ followed by an invalid sequence will now error.
    However, \u without a following { is unaffected, so "\u202e" won't error and
    will work the same as before.
  . zend_function.common.num_args don't include the variadic argument anymore.
  . ob_start() no longer issues an E_ERROR, but instead an E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR in case an 
    output buffer is created in an output buffer handler.
  . Removed support for assigning the result of new by reference.
  . Removed support for scoped calls to non-static methods from an incompatible
    $this context. See details in https://wiki.php.net/rfc/incompat_ctx.
  . Removed support for #-style comments in ini files. Use ;-style comments
    instead.
  . Added zend_memnstr_ex, which is based on string matching sunday algo.
  . Added zend_memnrstr, zend_memnrstr_ex.
  . Added hybrid sorting algo zend_sort for better performance.
  . Added stable sorting algo zend_insert_sort.
  . Invalid octal literals in source code now produce compile errors, fixing
    PHPSadness #31. Previously, the invalid digits (and any following valid 
    digits) were simply ignored, such that 0781 became 7.
  . Removed dl() function on fpm-fcgi.
  . Removed support for hexadecimal numeric strings. This means that some
    operations like == will no longer specially interpret strings containing
    hexadecimal numbers. Furthermore is_numeric() will not consider hexadecimal
    strings to be numeric (use FILTER_VALIDATE_INT instead).
    (RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/remove_hex_support_in_numeric_strings)

- Date:
  . Removed $is_dst parameter from mktime() and gmmktime().

- DBA
  . dba_delete() now returns false if the key was not found for the inifile
    handler, too.

- GMP
  . Requires libgmp version 4.2 or newer now.
  . gmp_setbit() and gmp_clrbit() now return FALSE for negative indices, making
    them consistent with other GMP functions.

- Session
  . session_start() accepts all INI settings as array. e.g. ['cache_limiter'=>'private']
    sets session.cache_limiter=private. It also supports 'read_and_close' which closes
    session data immediately after read data.
  . Save handler accepts validate_sid(), update_timestamp() which validates session
    ID existence, updates timestamp of session data. Compatibility of old user defined
    save handler is retained.
  . SessionUpdateTimestampHandlerInterface is added. validateSid(), updateTimestamp()
    is defined in the interface.
  . session.lazy_write(default=On) INI setting enables only write session data when
    session data is updated.

- PCRE:
  . Removed support for /e (PREG_REPLACE_EVAL) modifier. Use
    preg_reaplace_callback() instead.

- Standard:
  . Removed string category support in setlocale(). Use the LC_* constants
    instead.
  . Removed set_magic_quotes_runtime() and its alias magic_quotes_runtime().

- Stream:
  . Removed set_socket_blocking() in favor of its alias stream_set_blocking().

========================================
2. New Features
========================================

- Core
  . Added null coalesce operator (??).
    (RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/isset_ternary)
  . Support for strings with length >= 2^31 bytes in 64 bit builds.
  . Closure::call() method added.
  . Added \u{xxxxxx} Unicode Codepoint Escape Syntax for double-quoted strings
    and heredocs.
  . define() now supports arrays as constant values, fixing an oversight where define() did not support arrays yet const syntax did.

========================================
3. Changes in SAPI modules
========================================

- FPM
  . Fixed bug #65933 (Cannot specify config lines longer than 1024 bytes).
  . Listen = port now listen on all addresses (IPv6 and IPv4-mapped).

========================================
4. Deprecated Functionality
========================================


========================================
5. Changed Functions
========================================

- parse_ini_file():
- parse_ini_string():
  . Added scanner mode INI_SCANNER_TYPED to yield typed .ini values.
- unserialize():
  . Added second parameter for unserialize function 
    (RFC: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/secure_unserialize) allowing to specify
    acceptable classes: 
    unserialize($foo, ["allowed_classes" => ["MyClass", "MyClass2"]);


========================================
6. New Functions
========================================
- GMP
  . Added gmp_random_seed().

- Standard
  . Added intdiv() function for integer division.

========================================
7. New Classes and Interfaces
========================================


========================================
8. Removed Extensions
========================================


========================================
9. Other Changes to Extensions
========================================


========================================
10. New Global Constants
========================================

- Core
  . PHP_INT_MIN added.

========================================
11. Changes to INI File Handling
========================================

- Core
  . Removed asp_tags ini directive. Trying to enable it will result in a fatal
    error.

========================================
12. Windows Support
========================================

- Core
  . Support for native 64 bit integers in 64 bit builds.
  . Support for large files in 64 bit builds.

========================================
13. Other Changes
========================================

- Core
  . Instead of being undefined and platform-dependent, NaN and Infinity will
    always be zero when casted to integer.
  . Calling a method on a non-object no longer raises a fatal error; see
    also: https://wiki.php.net/rfc/catchable-call-to-member-of-non-object.
  . Error messages for zend_parse_parameters, type hints and conversions now always say "integer" and "float" instead of "long" and "double".

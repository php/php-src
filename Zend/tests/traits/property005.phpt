The same rules are applied for properties that are defined in the class hierarchy. Thus, if the properties are incompatible a fatal error occurs.

Fatal error: TraitsTest and THello1 define the same property ($hello) in the composition of TraitsTest. However, the definition differs and is considered incompatible. Class was composed in %s on line %d

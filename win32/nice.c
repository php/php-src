/*
 * Basic Windows implementation for the nice() function.
 *
 * This implementation uses SetPriorityClass() as a backend for defining
 * a process priority.
 *
 * The following values of inc, defines the value sent to SetPriorityClass():
 *
 *  +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
 *  | Expression            | Priority type                |
 *  +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
 *  | priority < -9         | HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS          |
 *  +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
 *  | priority < -4         | ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS  |
 *  +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
 *  | priority > 4          | BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS  |
 *  +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
 *  | priority > 9          | IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS          |
 *  +-----------------------+-----------------------------+
 *
 * If a value is between -4 and 4 (inclusive), then the priority will be set
 * to NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS.
 *
 * These values tries to mimic that of the UNIX version of nice().
 *
 * This is applied to the main process, not per thread, although this could
 * be implemented using SetThreadPriority() at one point.
 *
 * Note, the following priority classes are left out with intention:
 *
 *   . REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS
 *     Realtime priority class requires special system permissions to set, and
 *     can be dangerous in certain cases.
 *
 *   . PROCESS_MODE_BACKGROUND_BEGIN
 *   . PROCESS_MODE_BACKGROUND_END
 *     Process mode is not covered because it can easily forgotten to be changed
 *     back and can cause unforeseen side effects that is hard to debug. Besides
 *     that, these do generally not really fit into making a Windows somewhat
 *     compatible nice() function.

WHAT IS THIS?

    This module exploits the layered I/O support in Apache 2.0.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
    
    In Apache 2.0, you have handlers which generate content (like
    reading a script from disk). The content goes then through
    a chain of filters. PHP can be such a filter, so that it processes
    your script and hands the output to the next filter (which will
    usually cause a write to the network).

DOES IT WORK?

    It is experimental as interfaces in Apache 2.0 might change in the
    future.

HOW TO INSTALL

    This SAPI module is known to work with Apache 2.0.40.

        $ cd apache-2.x
        $ cd src
        $ ./configure --enable-so
        $ make install

    For testing purposes, you might want to use --with-mpm=prefork.
    (Albeit PHP also works with threaded MPMs.)

    Configure PHP 4:

        $ cd php-4.x
        $ ./configure --with-apxs2=/path/to/apache-2.0/bin/apxs
        $ make install
   
    At the end of conf/httpd.conf, add:

        AddType application/x-httpd-php .php

    If you would like to enable source code highlighting functionality add:
    
        AddType application/x-httpd-php-source .phps
    
    That's it. Now start bin/httpd.

HOW TO CONFIGURE

    The Apache 2.0 PHP module supports a new configuration directive that
    allows an admin to override the php.ini search path. For example,
    place your php.ini file in Apache's ServerRoot/conf directory and
    add this to your httpd.conf file:

        PHPINIDir "conf"

DEBUGGING APACHE AND PHP
    
    To debug Apache, we recommened:

        1. Use the Prefork MPM (Apache 1.3-like process model) by
           configuring Apache with '--with-mpm=prefork'.
        2. Start httpd using -DONE_PROCESS (e.g. (gdb) r -DONE_PROCESS).

    If you want to debug a part of the PHP startup procedure, set a 
    breakpoint on 'load_module'. Step through it until apr_dso_load() is 
    done. Then you can set a breakpoint on any PHP-related symbol.

TODO

    PHP functions like apache_sub_req (see php_functions.c)
    Protocol handlers
    Passing script data to engine without temporary file

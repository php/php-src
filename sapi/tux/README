README FOR THE TUX MODULE (by Sascha Schumann)        
($Date$)

    This is a SAPI module for the TUX web-server by Ingo Molnar.

    The special thing about TUX is that it is integrated into the Linux
    kernel and thus provides high-speed serving of static files.

    The web-server provides a user-space API which allows arbitrary 
    plug-ins to be made available. 

    All requests to the PHP userspace module are currently serialized.

    This module is of alpha quality.  Due to incomplete APIs, HTTP
    authentication and handling of POST requests has not been
    implemented yet.
 
    SECURITY NOTE: PHP will happily run everything under the
    web-root through the parser; so be careful what you put
    there.

    Note that requests are served in a chroot'ed environment.
    The initialization of PHP does not take place in the chroot'ed
    environment, so that e.g. /usr/local/lib/php.ini is treated
    as usual.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

    1. Install TUX as outlined in the QuickStart text.
       Create /tux-modules where modules will reside.
    
    2. Prepare PHP

       $ cd php-*
       $ ./configure \
            --with-tux=/tux-modules \
    		<further PHP options>
       # make install
    
       You can see the list of valid PHP options by executing

       $ ./configure --help

    3. Touch a file in your web-root 'php7.tux'.  This will
       cause requests to '/php7.tux' to be redirected to the
       userspace module php7.tux.

    4. Start TUX with something like

       # tux -d -t 8 -r /www -m /tux-modules php7.tux
      
       (daemon mode, eight threads, web-root /www, modules in
        /tux-modules, load php7.tux)

       BEFORE running this command, the kernel side of TUX has to
       be properly setup.
       
    5. Try to access

           http://yourserver/php7.tux?=PHPB8B5F2A0-3C92-11d3-A3A9-4C7B08C10000

       It should display the PHP credits page.

       To access a script /foo/bar.php, use

           http://yourserver/php7.tux?/foo/bar.php

       Parameters can be appended:
       
           http://yourserver/php7.tux?/foo/bar.php&var=value

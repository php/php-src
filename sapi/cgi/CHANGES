In PHP5.3 all additional configure options (except --enable-cgi) are removed:

  --enable-fastcgi          CGI: If this is enabled, the cgi module will
                            be built with support for fastcgi also

                            Now fastcgi is always enabled

  --disable-path-info-check CGI: If this is disabled, paths such as
                            /info.php/test?a=b will fail to work

                            Now it is enabled by default, but can be disabled
                            with ini directive "cgi.fix_pathinfo=0"

  --enable-force-cgi-redirect
                            CGI: Enable the security check for internal server
                            redirects.  You should use this if you are
                            running the CGI version with Apache
  							
                            Now it is enabled by default, but can be disabled
                            with ini directive "cgi.force_redirect=0"

  --enable-discard-path     CGI: If this is enabled, the PHP CGI binary
                            can safely be placed outside of the
                            web tree and people will not be able
                            to circumvent .htaccess security

                            This option had effect only with
                            --disable-path-info-check or "cgi.fix_pathinfo=0".
                            Seems it needs only for CGI configuration that
                            require each script start from "#! /usr/bin/php".

                            Now it is disabled by default, but can be enabled
                            with ini directive "cgi.discard_path=1".

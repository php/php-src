AOLserver README ($Id$)

PHP 4 supports AOLserver 3.0+ and AOLserver 4 out-of-the-box.

Note that there might be thread-safety issues with thread-unsafe
libraries/extensions.  Test thoroughly before you put anything
into production.


1.) Installing AOLserver

    For AOLserver 4, ./configure; make; make install seems to be enough.

2.) Install PHP

    $ ./configure \
        --with-aolserver=/path/to/installed/aolserver \
        <other options>
    $ make
    $ make install

3.) Enabling PHP in your config.tcl

    Required steps:

    Locate the modules section:

        ns_section "ns/server/${servername}/modules"

    Under that, add this line:

        ns_param php ${bindir}/libphp4.so

    Add a new section at the end of config.tcl to enable PHP support:

        ns_section "ns/server/${servername}/module/php"
        ns_param map *.php
    
    Now, all *.php files will be handled by PHP.

    You can also configure INI variables. E.g.

        ns_param php_value "session.auto_start 1"

This has been tested with AOLserver release 3.1/4.0.

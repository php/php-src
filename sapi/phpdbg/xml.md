General tags
============

intro
-----

- appears on startup if -q flag wasn't provided as command line arg
- before any input possibility
- attributes may be spread over multiple tags
- wrapped in &lt;intros> tag

### attributes ###

- help: command name for help
- report: URL for bug reporting


phpdbg
------

- general text message output from phpdbg system

stream
------

### attributes ###

- type: stderr or stdout

php
---

- php error output

### attributes ###

- &lt;print> elements are wrapped in a &lt;printinfo> element
- there may be a variable number of &lt;print> elements with a variable count of args inside the &lt;printinfo> element
- possible args are:
 - readline: yes/no - readline enabled or disabled
 - libedit: yes/no - libedit enabled or disabled
 - context: current executing context
 - compiled: yes/no - are there actual compiled ops?
 - stepping: @@ TODO (meaningless for now) @@

### with a subcommand ###

- introduced by &lt;printinfo num="" /> (except for print opline) with num being the number of opcodes and one of these args:
 - file
 - method
 - function
 - class (then also type and flags attributes, see info classes command for their meanings)
 - symbol (also type and flags attributes; here the value of flags is either "Method" or "Function")
- if there is a class method, the methods are all wrapped in a &lt;printmethods> container
- then comes a &lt;printoplineinfo type="" /> where type is either "User" or "Internal"
- the &lt;printoplineinfo> has either a method or a function attribute
- if the type is "Internal"
 - there are no oplines, it's an internal method or function
- if the type is "User"
 - it has these attributes
   - startline: the first line of code where the method or function is defined
   - endline: the lastt line of code where the method or function is defined
   - file: the file of code where the method or function is defined
 - is followed by the oplines of that method or function (&lt;print> elements)
- &lt;print line="%u" opline="%p" opcode="%s" op="%s" />
- in case of print opline it emits a single &lt;opline line="" opline="" opcode="" op="" file="" />

exec
----

- command executing and compiling a given file
 - &lt;exec type="unset" context="" />: indicates unsetting of the old context
 - &lt;exec type="unsetops" />: indicates unsetting of the old compiled opcodes

 - &lt;exec>
  - invalid: given context (attribute) is not matching a valid file or symlink
  - notfound: given context (attribute) does not exist

run / &lt;stop> tag
-------------------

- runs the script (set via exec command)
- &lt;stop type="end" />: script execution ended normally
- (error) &lt;stop type="bailout" /> the VM bailed out (usually because there was some error)
- compile failures see under exec, errors, &lt;compile>

watch
-----

- watchpoints generally are identified by a variable (one may need to switch frames first...)
- &lt;watch variable="" />, &lt;watchrecursive variable="" /> and &lt;watcharray variable="" /> (normal, array, recursive)
- &lt;watch> if error, by type:
 - undefined: tried to set a watchpoint on a not (yet) defined variable

 - invalidinput: generally malformed input
- &lt;watchdelete variable="" />: when "watch delete" was used on a watchpoint
- (error) &lt;watchdelete type="nowatch" />: that watchpoint doesn't exist, so couldn't be deleted
- for hit watchpoints etc., see Other tags, &lt;watch*>
- when using watch list, &lt;watchvariable> elements are wrapped in a &lt;watchlist> container
 - &lt;watchvariable variable="" on="" type="" />
  - variable: watched variable (may be a variable of another scope!)
  - on: values are array or variable, depending on what is watched
  - type: values are recursive or simple, depending on whether the watchpoint is checked recursively or not

set
---

- a general error is type="wrongargs" where a wrong argument was passed to a subcommand; tag is then &lt;set*>

### prompt ###

- without other args, a &lt;setpromt str="" /> tag is emitted where the value of the str attribute is the value of the prompt
- when there is another arg, the prompt is changed to that arg, no further xml answer

### break ###

- enables / disables a given breakpoint silently with no further xml answer
- if the boolean switch is omitted, it emits current state in a &lt;setbreak id="" active="" /> where active is on or off
- error with type="nobreak", when no breakpoint with the given id exists

### breaks ###

- generally enables / disables breakpoint functionality silently with no further xml answer
- if the boolean switch is omitted, it emits current state in a &lt;setbreaks active="" /> where active is on or off

### color ###

- sets the color on prompt, error or notices
- &lt;setcolor type="" color="" code="" />: code is the color code of color, type is either:
 - prompt
 - error
 - notice
- errors by type:
 - nocolor: color doesn't exist
 - invalidtype: type wasn't one of the three allowed types

### colors ###

- generally enables / disables colors silently with no further xml answer
- if the boolean switch is omitted, it emits current state in a &lt;setcolors active="" /> where active is on or off

### oplog ###

- sets oplog
- (error) &lt;setoplog type="openfailure" file="" /> when it couldn't open the passed file path

- if no further argument is passed, it emits current state in a &lt;setoplog active="" /> where active is on or off

### quiet ###

- generally enables / disables quietness silently with no further xml answer
- if the boolean switch is omitted, it emits current state in a &lt;setquiet active="" /> where active is on or off

### setpping ###

- sets stepping to either opcode or line (so a step command will either advance one op or one line)
- if no further argument is passed, it emits current state in a &lt;setoplog type="" /> where active is opcode or line

### refcount ###

- generally enables / disables showing of refcount in watchpoint breaks silently with no further xml answer
- if the boolean switch is omitted, it emits current state in a &lt;setrefcount active="" /> where active is on or off

wait
----

- internally executes exec, so exec will output first (if binding to socket worked)

### attributes ###

- import: has value "success"/"fail"
- missingmodule/missingextension: modules/extensions loaded in the target SAPI, but not in phpdbg

### errors (by type) ###

- nosocket: couldn't establish socket

- if a relative path is passed, it's relative to the extension_dir ini setting

### attributes ###

- extensiontype: "Zend extension" or "module"
- name: the extension name
- path: the path where it was loaded

### errors (by type) ###

- unsupported: dynamic extension loading is unsupported
- relpath: relative path given, but no extension_dir defined

- registerfailure: registering module failed
- startupfailure: couldn't startup Zend extension / module
- initfailure: couldn't initialize module
- nophpso: passed shared object is not a valid Zend extension nor module

-----------

- received caught signal

### attributes ###

- type: type of signal (e.g. SIGINT)

### by type ###

- SIGINT: interactive mode is entered...

&lt;watch*>
-----------

- generally emitted on hit watchpoint
- &lt;watchdelete variable="" />: when a variable was unset, the watchpoint is removed too
- &lt;watchhit variable="" />: when ever a watched variable is changed, followed by a &lt;watchdata> container
- &lt;watchdata> may contain
 - for watchpoints on variables:
  - each of these &lt;watch*> tags contains a type attribute whose value is either "old" or "new")
  - &lt;watchvalue type="" inaccessible="inaccessible" />: old value is inaccessible
  - &lt;watchvalue type=""> may contain a &lt;stream> element which indicates the old/new (type attribute) value of the variable
  - &lt;watchrefcount type="" refcount="" isref="" />: old/new (type attribute) refcount and isref, both numbers
   - isref: if the value is 0, it's not a reference, else it is one

  - &lt;watchsize> inspects size variations of an array (the sum):
   - removed: number of elements removed
   - added: number of elements added
  - &lt;watcharrayptr>: if this tag appears, the internal pointer of the array way changed

&lt;signalsegv>
---------------

- generally emitted when data couldn't be fetched (e.g. by accessing inconsistent data); only used in hard interrupt mode
- it might mean that data couldn't be fetched at all, or that only incomplete data was fetched (e.g. when a fixed number of following attributes are fetched, this tag will mark a stop of fetching if none or not all tags were printed)

README FOR THTTPD MODULE (by Sascha Schumann)        
($Date$)

	This is a SAPI module for PHP 4.0 supporting thttpd, the tiny,
	turbo, throttling HTTP server by Jef Poskanzer.

	The module contains a patch against version 2.21b of thttpd. The patch
	adds hooks to thttpd to call PHP, if a filename matches *.php. This
	patch will be applied when you install PHP.

	NOTE: This version supports *only* thttpd 2.21b, no prior or later
	version.

	This is a functional and stable module (it runs a large application
	like IMP 2.2.0 without any problems). Its original intention was to
	demonstrate the ability of PHP to work in every web server environment.

	NOTE: All requests will be serialized. That means, one long running
	      script will block all other requests. Choose another web-server,
	      if you want to execute arbitrary scripts.

Comparing: sprintf, snprintf, slprintf, spprintf

sprintf  offers the ability to make a lot of failures since it does not know
         the size of the buffer it uses. Therefore usage of sprintf often
         results in possible entries for buffer overrun attacks. So please
         use this version only if you are sure the call is safe. sprintf
         always terminstes the buffer it writes to.

snprintf knows the buffers size and will not write behind it. But you will
         have to use either a static buffer or allocate a dynamic buffer
         before being able to call the function. In other words you must
         be sure that you really know the maximum size of the buffer required.
         A bad thing is having a big maximum while in most cases you would
         only need a small buffer. If the size of the resulting string is
         longer or equal to the buffer size than the buffer is not terminated.
         The function also returns the number of chars not including the
         terminating \0 that were needed to fully comply to the print request.

slprintf same as snprintf with the difference that it actually returns the
         length printed not including the terminating \0.

spprintf is the dynamical version of snprintf. It allocates the buffer in size
         as needed and allows a maximum setting as snprintf (turn this feature
         off by setting max_len to 0). spprintf is a little bit slower than
         snprintf and offers possible memory leakes if you miss freeing the
         buffer allocated by the function. Therefore this function should be
         used where either no maximum is known or the maximum is much bigger
         than normal size required. spprintf always terminates the buffer.

Example:

 #define MAX 1024              | #define MAX 1024               | #define MAX 1024
 char buffer[MAX]              | char buffer[MAX]               | char *buffer;
                               |                                |
                               |                                | // No need to initialize buffer:
                               |                                | // spprintf ignores value of buffer
 sprintf(buffer, "test");      | snprintf(buffer, MAX, "test"); | spprintf(&buffer, MAX, "text");
                               |                                | if (!buffer)
                               |                                |   return OUT_OF_MEMORY
 // sprintf always terminates | // manual termination of       | // spprintf allays terminates buffer
 // buffer                     | // buffer *IS* required        |
                               | buffer[MAX-1] = 0;             |
 action_with_buffer(buffer);   | action_with_buffer(buffer);    | action_with_buffer(buffer);
                               |                                | efree(buffer);
